# Introduction {#INTRO}

Internationalization is a complex topic with its own set of
terminology (see {{RFC6365}}).  The topic is
made more difficult to understand for the NFSv4 protocols by
the complicated history
described in {{HIST}}.   In large part, this document is based on the
actual behavior of NFSv4 client and server implementations
(for all existing minor versions).  It is intended to serve as a basis
for further implementations to be developed that can interact
with existing implementations.  It is expected to enable interoperation
with implementations to be developed
in the future.

Note that the set of behaviors on which this document is based are
each effected
by a
combination of an NFSv4 server implementation proper and a
server-side underlying file system. It is common for servers
and underlying file systems to be configurable as to the behavior shown.
In the discussion below, each configuration that shows different
behavior is to be considered separately.

As a consequence of this approach, normative terms defined
in {{RFC2119}} are often derived from implementation
behavior, rather than the other way around, as is more commonly
the case.  The specifics
are discussed in {{TERM}}.

With regard to the question of interoperability with existing
specifications for NFSv4 minor versions, different minor versions
pose different issues, even though the actual behavior is the same
for all minor versions.  This is because some of the specifications were
often adopted without the appropriate concern for usability,
implementability, or the expectations of existing NFS users.


* With regard to NFSv4.0 as defined in {{RFC7530}},
  no significant interoperability
  issues are expected to arise because the discussion of
  internationalization in that
  specification, which is the basis for this one, was also based
  on the behavior of existing implementations.   Although, in a
  formal sense, the treatment of internationalization here supersedes
  that in {{RFC7530}}, the treatments are intended to
  be the same, in order to eliminate the possibility
  of interoperability issues.

  Because of a change in the handling of Internationalized domain names,
  there are some differences from the handling in {{RFC7530}}, as
  discussed in {{HIST}}.
  For a discussion of those differences and potential compatibility
  issues, see Sections {{<OTHER-idna}} and {{<OTHER-compat}}.

* With regard to NFSv4.1 as defined by {{RFC8881}},
  the situation is
  quite different.   The approach to internationalization specified
  in that document, based in large part on that in RFC3530,
  was never implemented, and implementers were either
  unaware of the troublesome implications of that approach or
  chose to ignore the existing specifications as essentially
  unimplementable.  An
  internationalization
  approach compatible with that specified in {{RFC7530}} tended to be followed,
  despite the fact that, in other respects, NFSv4.1 was considered to be
  a separate protocol from NFSv4.0.

  If there were NFSv4 servers who obeyed the internationalization
  dictates
  within {{RFC5661}}, or clients that
  expected servers to
  do so, they would fail to interoperate with typical clients and servers
  when dealing with non-UTF8 file names, which are quite common.  As
  no such implementations have come to our attention, it has to be assumed
  that they do not exist and interoperability with existing
  implementations as described here is an appropriate basis for
  this document.

  The same applies to all existing minor versions beyond NFSv4.1
  (i.e. to NFSv4.2), which made
  no changes in the specification of internationalization-related
  handling and for which existing implementation patterns were
  maintained.

There is one area within the protocol for which existing implementations
are somewhat limited, so that it is not
always possible to derive the details of the specification from existing
implementations.  This area addresses situations in which,
in response to user needs, it is necessary to treat distinct strings
as equivalent based on an equivalence relation applying to UTF8-encoded
Unicode strings. In order to provide this internationalization-related
functionality, it is necessary, as described in {{SERVTYPES}}, for the
server to be aware of the encoding
of strings used for file names, as UTF8-encoded Unicode.

There are several classes of equivalence relations, for which we
have limited implementation experience:


* NFSv4 implementations MAY treat two canonically
  equivalent
  strings as denoting the same object.

  While the ability for servers to do that is an NFSv4 design
  requirement necessary to provide support for Unicode normalization,
  and some implementations do exist,
  there has, so far, been little demand for this feature and
  current implementations are not heavily used.

  As a result, the support for such features described here, while
  derived from implementation experience, has only been used
  in a small set of situations and might have difficulties with
  some existing clients that do various forms of name caching.
  See {{EQUIV-canon}} for further
  discussion.

* NFSv4 implementations MAY treat two
  strings that differ only as to case as denoting the same object.
  While server implementations exist, the details are unclear because
  of the complexity of case-mapping and case-based string equivalence
  in an internationalized environment.

  Because the details of case mapping and case-insensitive string
  comparison can be complex in an internationalized environment,
  with desirable mappings depending on user preference and the use
  of different languages, the definition of appropriate mappings
  cannot be done within this specification, although the issues that
  need to be dealt with are discussed in {{EQUIV-case}}


# Terminology {#TERM}

## Requirements Language Definition {#TERM-req}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


## General Definitions {#TERM-gdef}

The following terms are used in this document as defined below.


Canonical Equivalence (of strings):
: In Unicode, two strings are considered canonically equivalent if
  they can be assumed to have the same appearance and meaning
  when printed or displayed.

  For further detail and examples, see {{EQUIV-canon}}.

Case-insensitive File System
: treat file names that differ only in case (e.g. "a" and "A") as
  the same, allowing only one such to exist in a given directory.

  The decision as to whether two strings differ only as to case can
  be a complicated one in general, because different languages have different
  rules (e.g. dotted and dotless i's in Turkic languages) and because
  different versions of Unicode include different sets of characters
  with different case mappings.

Case-sensitive File System
: treat file names that differ only in case (e.g. "a" and "A") as
  distinct, allowing each to designate a different file in a
  directory.

  Such file systems are easier to deal with because they do not
  to define case mappings and are consistent with the assumptions
  of POSIX.

Underlying File System
: The realization of a server-side file systems used to
  implement requests made using the NFSv4 protocol.

  Most often, such file systems can be used by other
  remote access protocols or to effect locally requested
  file operations

UTF8-aware File System
: assume use of Unicode as encoded using UTF-8 by both client and
  server.

  This shared knowledge allows the server to support case-insensitive
  file systems and those that treat canonically equivalent names
  as designating the same file.

UTF8-unaware File System
: do not make any assumptions as to the interpretation of
  the strings within component names.

  Two component names are considered equivalent only if they are
  identical.

  Such file systems cannot be case-insensitive or deal
  with Unicode normalization issues.


# Internationalization and Minor Versioning {#MINOR}

Despite the fact that NFSv4.0 and subsequent minor versions
have differed in many ways, the actual implementations of
internationalization have
remained the same and internationalized file names have been handled
without regard to the minor version being used. Minor version
specification documents contained different treatments of
internationalization as described in {{HIST}} but of those
only the implementation-based approach used by {{RFC7530}}, resulted in
a workable description while
a number of attempts to specify another approach that implementers
were to follow were all ignored by implementers.

It is expected that any future minor versions will follow a similar
approach, even though it is possible that a future minor
version will adopt a different approach as long as the rules
within {{RFC8178}}) are adhered to.   In any such case,
the new minor version would have to be marked as updating or obsoleting
this document.   Some issues relating to potential extensions within the
framework specified in this document are dealt with in
Appendices {{<INFO-casei}} and {{<INFO-norm}}.


# Changes Relative to RFC7530 {#CHG7530}

This document follows the internationalization approach defined
in RFC7530, with a number of significant changes listed
below, all necessary to provide an updated treatment that can
be used for all minor versions.

The making this shift, the handling of internationalization specified
in {{RFC7530}} is applied to all NFSv4 minor versions.
No compatibility issues are expected to arise because all
existing implementations follow the same approach to
internationalization despite the large difference between {{RFC7530}}
and what is specified in {{RFC8881}}.

The following changes were necessary:


* Issues
  relating to potential future minor versions
  and protocol extensions are addressed in {{FUTURE}}.

* Changes made necessary by the shift from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008
  have been made. The
  intention is to maintain
  compatibility with all existing implementations of all NFSv4 minor
  versions.   Potential compatibility issues with regard to the IDNA
  shift are discussed in {{OTHER-compat}}.

* There is more discussion of case-insensitive
  handling of file names, with particular attention to the complexities
  that can arise when multiple language conventions in these matters
  need to be accommodated.  Because of the need to
  accommodate these complexities, the protocol leaves these details
  up to the server while the material in Appendices {{<INFO-casei-ex}}
  and {{<INFO-casei-def}} provides
  a helpful introduction to these issues.

* There is additional material, dealing with the implications of
  server-side internationalization-related file name processing for
  clients' use of certain name caching techniques.  This
  includes a discussion of options to deal with the current lack of
  detailed information about the server (in
  Sections {{<EQUIV-canon}} and {{<EQUIV-case}},
  and options for handling this issue until more detailed information
  can be made available to the client
  (in {{EQUIV-clcache}})."

* A discussion of the OPTIONAL attribute
  fs_charset_cap has been added.

* A previous discussion of the behavior of certain file systems
  that could be construed as suggesting (even though the words
  "SHOULD NOT were used, that it was valid for a
  server to perform normalization-related processing on names
  without rejecting names that are not valid UTF-8 strings.

  That text has now been deleted and other text clarifies that this
  is not valid behavior.


# Limitations on Internationalization-Related Processing in the NFSv4 Context {#LIMITS}

There are a number of noteworthy circumstances that limit the degree
to which internationalization-related encoding and normalization-
related restrictions can be made universal
with regard to NFSv4 clients and servers:


* The NFSv4 client is part of an extensive set of client-side software
  components whose design and internal interfaces are not within the
  IETF's purview, limiting the degree to which a particular character
  encoding might be made standard.

* Server-side handling of file component names is most often
  implemented within a server-side underlying file system, whose
  handling of character encoding and normalization is not
  specifiable by the IETF.

* Typical implementation patterns in UNIX systems and the POSIX
  handling of file name strings result in the
  NFSv4 client having no knowledge of the character encoding being
  used, which might even vary between processes on the same client
  system.

* Users may need access to files stored previously with non-UTF-8
  encodings, or with UTF-8 encodings that are not in accord with any
  particular normalization form.

Despite the above, there are cases in which UTF8-related
processing can be provided by servers, as described in
Sections {{<EQUIV}} and {{<SERVTYPES}}.


# Server Behavior Types {#SERVTYPES}

There are two basic types of server filesystems supported by
NFSv4, which differ in their handling of internationalization-
related issues, as they apply to the handling of the names of
file system objects.  The details of how these types affect
the handling of potential string equivalence relationships are
discussed in {{EQUIV}}.

These two types of file systems can be
distinguished based on the value of the flag
FSCHARSET_CAP4_ALLOWS_ONLY_UTF8 in the value returned by
the fs_charset_cap attribute.


* Servers which do not rely on knowledge of the encoding used
  for name strings are termed "UTF8-unaware".  Because such
  servers, when handling file names, do not rely on any
  particular encoding
  being used, they can be used with a range of character
  encodings, in the same way that was done when using NFSv3.

  This flexibility is necessary to enable access to existing
  files stored with names using existing encodings.
  However, the lack of
  server knowledge of the encoding used results in such
  servers' inability to provide the kind of services described
  in {{EQUIV}} that rely on the ability to treat
  sets of distinct strings as equivalent, for the purpose of
  handling normalization issues and providing case-insensitivity.

  Because the server has no ability to define name string
  equivalence relations, clients can cache names without
  knowledge of the encoding used by the server.

* Servers that are aware of the encoding of strings using the
  UTF-8 encoding of Unicode are termed "UTF8-aware".  Such
  servers are able to provide normalization-related handling
  as described in {{EQUIV-canon}} and case-insensitivity
  as described in {{EQUIV-case}} by defining
  equivalence relations that treat defined sets of strings as
  equivalent for naming purposes.

  Because of the ability of such servers to define name
  equivalence relations, certain forms of name caching can be
  interfered with because the client is not aware of the
  equivalence relation used. Because of this lack of knowledge,
  forms of name caching where the name used to refer to a file
  is not expected to change can be interfered with.

In the case of UTF8-aware filesystems, server decisions with
regard to normalization handling and case-insensitivity are
independent but implementers need to be aware of some
potential interactions.


* Because there is no way for the client to determine whether
  normalization-related processing is in effect, the client might
  need to act as if it is used for all UTF8-aware file systems.

* When both normalization-related processing and case-insensitivity
  are to be implemented, those two functions can be provided together.
  The server can use string equivalence relations that provide
  both functions, by treating two strings as equivalent if they are
  canonically equivalent or differ only as to case.

  See {{IMPL-formi}} for a discussion of implementing
  string comparisons given the existence of such a common equivalence.
  It is worth nothing that, when clients are made aware of server
  string equivalence relations, using facilities such as those
  described in Appendices {{<INFO-casei}} and {{<INFO-norm}}, the client and
  server can use the same string equivalence relation, enabling
  the previously necessary restrictions on client-side name caching
  to be eliminated.


# Handling of String Equivalence {#EQUIV}

Although many NFSv4 implementations continue the approach to
string names used in NFSv3 in which the only equivalent strings
are identical, others provide support for various
sort of string equivalence relations as described in Sections
{{<EQUIV-canon}} and {{<EQUIV-case}} below.

The earlier approach dealt with internationalization outside the scope
of the protocol, by making internationalization the job of the
user, requiring the client user and server to agree on the
character encoding being used while the implementations themselves
strived for
character-encoding neutrality with knowledge of the encoding by the
implementations limited to the encoding of strings such as
"/", ".", and "..".

As discussed later in {{SERVTYPES}}, NFSv4 supports
multiple modes of operation in dealing with these matters.
While NFSv4 supports the older mode of operation by allowing
UTF8-unaware file systems, the  protocol also supports the
use of UTF8-aware file systems in which both sides of the
implementation deal with filenames as UTF8-encoded Unicode strings,
enabling
equivalence classes of those strings to be used within the protocol.

When equivalence classes of string are implemented, this can be done
in two ways:


* Equivalent strings are treated as identical in matching names
  with associated files.  This typically requires special code
  within the server-side file system, rather than in the server proper.

* Name strings may be mapped to equivalent names resulting in a
  file having an equivalent name rather than the one specified by
  the client.  This approach is implementable within the server
  proper.

The existence of distinct equivalent strings does not, by and large,
cause troublesome issues for clients, who can function without
detailed knowledge of the equivalence relation(s) implemented.
However, as noted in {{EQUIV-clcache}}, certain
forms of client caching are not workable or need to be
heavily restricted,
in environments in which such string equivalences re implemented
by the server.

## Handling of Canonical Equivalence of Strings {#EQUIV-canon}

It is often desirable to treat two strings that are essentially the
name, although normalized differently, as equivalent. Such equivalences
can arise in multiple ways:


* In some cases, two Unicode values are assigned to a single
  glyph, because those two values represent different meanings of the
  same symbol.  For example, OHM SIGN (U+2126) denotes the same
  symbol as GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9) and the two are
  considered canonically equivalent.

* There are a large number of situations in which a particular
  symbol can be represented as a single character or as a combination
  of a base character and a combining character adding a
  diacritic.  For example,
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E ACUTE (U+00C9) can also represented by
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E (U+0045) followed by
  COMBINING ACTUE ACCENT (U+0301).  These two strings are
  canonically equivalent.

  Generally, when such pairs exist, the form in which the
  diacritic is integrated into the symbol is designated the
  NFC form while the other is the NFD form.

Whenever a set of at least two canonically equivalent strings
exists, one of
these is one that is the NFC form and one is the NFD form.
These are usually different although this is not always the
case.
Some examples:


1. OHM SIGN (U+2126) is canonically equivalent to
   GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9).

   In this case, the NFC and NFD forms are the same and both are
   GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9).

2. The two strings
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E ACUTE (U+00C9) and
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E (U+0045) followed by
   COMBINING ACTUE ACCENT (U+0301) are canonically equivalent.

   In this case, the NFC form is
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E ACUTE (U+00C9) while the NFD form
   is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E (U+0045) followed by
   COMBINING ACTUE ACCENT (U+0301).

3. The three strings ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B),
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5), and
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041) followed
   by COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A) are all canonically
   equivalent

   In this case, the NFC form is
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5) while the
   NFD form is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041) followed
   by COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A).

4. Sets of canonically equivalent strings can be arbitrarily large.
   For example, the twelve strings each consisting of one string
   from each of 1), 2), and 3) above are all canonically
   equivalent.

   In this case, the NFC form is of each of these twelve strings
   GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9) followed by
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E ACUTE (U+00C9) followed by
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5).

   In contrast, the NFD form of each of these twelve strings is
   GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9) followed by
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E (U+0045) followed by
   COMBINING ACTUE ACCENT (U+0301) followed by
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041) followed
   by COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A).

While all of the above examples would be dealt with as
stated above, regardless of the version of Unicode
used by the server, the canonical equivalence relation
is subject to change.  This is because successive Unicode
versions can add characters, creating instances of NFC
form strings that did not exist previously.

In the context of NFSv4 servers, such equivalences can only be
acted upon in the context of UTF8-aware file systems.  In that
context:


* Servers MAY map name strings to other
  canonically equivalent strings, so that the name of a file
  can be different from the name specified by the user.

  Clients are expected to be tolerant of such mappings while
  many users are likely to consider canonically equivalent strings
  as being the same. Users who consider such strings as  different
  would use UTF8-unaware file systems or those that did not
  modify user names.

* Servers MAY treat canonically equivalent
  strings as identical when searching for a given file without
  making any change in the names presented when the file is
  created.

  Clients are expected to be tolerant of such mappings while
  most users are likely to consider canonically equivalent strings
  as being the same. Users who consider these different
  would normally use UTF8-unaware file systems.

* While some other protocols deal with normalization issues by
  rejecting strings that are not in a particular normalization
  form, this option is not available to NFSv4 servers and NFsv4
  clients are not required to abide by server-imposed
  normalization-form constraints

  Because the canonical equivalence relation can change,
  placing the burden of adapting to a particular normalization
  form and Unicode version would create a difficult-to-maintain
  file access API.

* Although clients can generally avoid any concern with the
  server's approach to normalization issues, there are,
  as described {{EQUIV-clcache}}, some
  forms of client-side name caching for which the fact that the
  server treats two different strings as equivalent makes it
  desirable for the client do so as well, or not use those
  forms of name caching.

  Because of the current inability of the client to determine
  the Unicode version used by the server, such forms of name
  caching are best avoided when using UTF8-aware file systems
  However {{IMPL-cache}} discusses
  available possibilities for providing restrictions on
  such forms of name caching without eliminating them.

  For a discussion of how the client might be made aware of
  the specific canonical equivalence relation used by the server,
  see {{INFO-norm}}.


## Handling of Case-insensitive Equivalence of Strings {#EQUIV-case}

In many environments it is desirable to treat two strings as
equivalent if they differ only as to case.  This need arises
when using operating environments in which file names are treated
in a case-insensitive manner.  While determining
whether two strings are equivalent except for case, can,
in many environments, be a straightforward
matter, there are, in internationalized environments, situations
in which user language preference or other similar considerations
require the server implementer to make choices in this regard.
See {{INFO-casei-ex}} for a discussion of these
cases.

In the context of NFSv4 servers, such equivalences can only be
acted upon in the context of UTF8-aware file systems.  In that
context:


* Servers MAY map a name string to another
  string equivalent except with regard to case, so that the name
  of a file can be different than the name requested by the user.

  When the OPTIONAL attributes case_insensitive
  and case_preserving are implemented, their values will both
  be false.

* Servers MAY treat name strings that only differ as
  to case as identical when searching for a given file without
  making any change in the name presented when the file is
  created.

  When the OPTIONAL attributes case_insensitive
  and case_preserving are implemented, their values will be true
  and false, respectively.

* Although clients can generally avoid any concern with the
  server's approach to case-handling issues, there are,
  as described {{EQUIV-clcache}}, some
  forms of client-side name caching for which the fact that the
  server treats two different strings as equivalent make it
  desirable for the client do so as well.

  Because of the current inability of the client to find out
  the details of the case equivalence relation use by the
  server, such forms of name
  caching are best avoided when using case-insensitive file
  systems.  However {{IMPL-cache}} discusses
  available possibilities for providing restrictions on
  such forms of name caching without eliminating them.

  For a discussion of how the client might be made aware of
  the case-equivalence relation used by the server, see {{INFO-casei}}.


## String Equivalence and Client Name Caching {#EQUIV-clcache}

While most client functions are not affected by a server's
implementation of various equivalence classes, there are a
number of forms of name caching that require the client to
be aware of string equivalence classes implemented by the server


* If the client implements negative name caching by caching the
  results of LOOKUP, OPEN, or ACCESS operations that find that
  the file does not exist, the server's treatment of two
  distinct strings as equivalent creates a potential problem.

  When negative name caching is implemented, there needs to be
  ways to eliminate records of the non-existence of particular
  files when they are no longer appropriate.  This will occur
  when the files are found using LOOKUP, OPEN, or ACCESS or
  when names are added to the directory using OPEN, CREATE,
  LINK, or RENAME.  When name equivalence relationships exist
  on the server, the client cannot act appropriately when
  files with previously non-existing names
  are found or created using distinct names considered
  equivalent.

* If the client uses the results of earlier READDIR operations
  to enable later LOOKUP operations to be avoided, the
  efficiency of that caching is undercut when the client
  is unaware of the details of these equivalence relations.

  In such situations, the client's cached READDIR entry cannot
  be used, as it would on the server, to satisfy a LOOKUP for a
  distinct name equivalent to the first, requiring an over-the-wire
  operation that such caching is intended to avoid.

Because of these issues, when name equivalences are in effect,
the above forms of caching cannot work effectively and are
best avoided.



# Servers That Accept File Component Names That Are Not Valid UTF-8 Strings {#NONVALID}

Servers MAY accept, on all
or on some
subset of the underlying file systems exported, component names
that are not valid UTF-8 strings.

A typical pattern is for
a server to use UTF{{&nbhy}}8-unaware underlying file systems that treat
component names as uninterpreted strings of bytes, rather
than having any awareness of the character set being used.

Such servers MUST use an octet-by-octet comparison of component name
strings to determine equivalence (as opposed to any broader notion of
string comparison).

This is because the server has no
knowledge of the specific character encoding being used.


# The Attribute Fs_charset_cap {#CHARSET}

This OPTIONAL attribute, appears to have been
added to NFSv4.1 to allow servers, while staying within the
constraints of the stringprep-based specification of
internationalization, to allow uses of UTF-8-unaware naming
by clients.  As a result, those NFSv4 servers implementing
internationalization as NFSv3 had done, could be considered
spec-compliant, as long as a later "SHOULD"
was ignored.  However,
because use of UTF-8 was tied to existing stringprep
restrictions, implementations of internationalization, that
were aware of Unicode canonical equivalence issues were not
provided for.  Although this attribute may have been implemented
despite the lack of need for two separate bits, the
overall scheme was never implemented and NFSv4.1 implementations
dealt with internationalization in the same way as NFSv4.0
implementations had.

The attribute still contains two flag bits although the
motivation for having two bits remains unclear.

# String Encoding {#ENCODE}

Strings that potentially contain characters outside the ASCII range
{{RFC20}} are generally represented in NFSv4 using the UTF-8 encoding
{{RFC3629}} of Unicode {{UNICODE}}.
See {{RFC3629}} for precise encoding and decoding rules.

Some details of the protocol treatment depend on the type of string:


* For strings that are component names, the preferred encoding for any
  non-ASCII characters, when the encoding is known by client
  and server, is the UTF-8 representation of Unicode.

  In many cases, clients have no knowledge of the encoding
  being used, with the encoding done at the user level under
  the control of a per-process locale specification. As a result,
  it is impossible in such cases for the NFSv4 client to enforce the
  use of UTF-8. The use of such encodings can be
  problematic, since it may interfere with access to files
  stored using other forms of name encoding. Also,
  normalization-related
  processing (see {{EQUIV-canon}}) of a string
  not encoded in UTF-8 could result in inappropriate name
  modification or aliasing.  In cases in which one has a
  non-UTF-8 encoded name that accidentally conforms to
  UTF-8 rules, substitution of canonically equivalent strings
  can change the non-UTF-8 encoded name drastically.

  For similar reasons, where non-UTF-8 encoded names are
  accepted, case-related mappings cannot be relied upon.  For
  this reason, the attribute case_insensitive MUST NOT be
  returned as TRUE for file systems which accept non-UTF-8 encoded
  file names.

  The kinds of modification and aliasing mentioned here can
  lead to both false negatives and false positives, depending on
  the strings in question, which can result in security
  issues such as elevation of privilege and denial of service
  (see {{RFC6943}} for further discussion).

* For strings based on domain names, non-ASCII characters MUST be
  represented using the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode or some
  encoding based on that (e.g. xn-labels including Punycode),
  and additional
  string format restrictions will apply.
  See {{OTHER}} for details.

* The contents of symbolic links (of type linktext4 in the
  XDR) MUST be treated as opaque data by NFSv4 servers.
  Although UTF-8 encoding is often used, it need not be.
  In this respect, the contents of symbolic links are like
  the contents of regular files in that their encoding is
  not within the scope of this specification.

* For other sorts of strings, any non-ASCII characters SHOULD be
  represented using the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode.


# String Types with Processing Defined by Other Internet Areas {#OTHER}

There are two types of strings that NFSv4 deals with that are based
on domain names.  Processing of such strings is defined by other
standards-track documents, and hence the processing behavior for such
strings should be consistent across all server and client operating
systems
and server file systems.

This section differs from other sections of this document in two
respects:


* Although the normative statements within this section are derived
  from the behavior of existing NFSv4 implementations, they need to
  be consistent with existing RFCs regarding domain handling.

* Because of the switch from IDNA2003 {{RFC3490}} {{RFC3491}} to IDNA2008
  {{RFC5890}}, this section is necessarily different from the
  corresponding section (i.e. Section 12.6) of {{RFC7530}}. The
  differences are discussed in {{OTHER-idna}}.

Because of this shift, there could be compatibility issues to be
expected between implementations obeying {{Section 12.6 of RFC7530}}, if
any such implementations exist, and those following this document.
Whether such compatibility issues actually exist depends on the
behavior of NFSv4 implementations and how domain names are actually
used in existing implementations.
These matters will be discussed in {{OTHER-compat}}.

The types of strings referred to above are as follows:


* Server names as they appear in the fs_locations and
  fs_locations_info attribute.  Note
  that for most purposes, such server names will only be sent by the
  server to the client.  The exception is the use of
  these attributes in a VERIFY or NVERIFY operation.

* Principal suffixes that are used to denote sets of users and
  groups, and are in the form of domain names.  These may appear
  in the owner and group attributes and as who values within ACEs
  that appear within ACL-related attributes.  Such values are sent by
  the client to the
  server in performing SETATTR, VERIFY, and NVERIFY operations and
  returned to the client in performing GETATTR operations.

There is likely to be few or no implementations conforming to
Section 12.6) of {{RFC7530}} as a result of how
internationalization was supported previously.


* When {{RFC3530}} was published, its discussion
  of internationalization was ignored as unimplementable and
  inappropriate.  This included the handling of domain names,
  although the reasons for ignoring the
  specification might have been different in that case.

* When {{RFC7530}} was published, implementers saw
  no reason to modify the existing domain-handling code which
  worked adequately for valid domain names.

These strings can be expressed in two ways:


* As the UTF-8 representation of the string represented.  This
  includes cases in which all of the characters are within the
  Ascii range.  We refer to such representations as the U-label
  form.

* As the string "`xn--`" followed by the text of the string transformed
  using the Punycode encoding described in {{RFC3492}}.
  We refer to such representations as the xn-label form.

In cases in which such strings are sent by the client to the server:


* The server MUST accept such strings in xn-label form.

  When it does so, MAY reject, using the error
  NFS4ERR_INVAL, any of the following:

  * a string
    for which the characters after "`xn--`" are not valid output of
    the Punycode algorithm {{RFC3492}}.

  * a string that contains a reserved LDH label
    (see {{RFC5890}}) which is not an
    XN{{&nbhy}}label.


* The server MAY accept such strings in U-label form and
  is REQUIRED to do so only in the case in which the
  string consists only of ascii characters.

  The server MAY reject, using the error
  NFS4ERR_INVAL, strings which are not valid UTF-8 or do not
  form a valid U-label for other reasons.

When the server does not make the validity checks mentioned above,
the result will be use
of an invalid domain name.  Since such domains do not exist, clients
are unlikely to use them and servers will be unable to access such
domains.

Servers MUST NOT modify the string to a canonically
equivalent one (e.g. as part of normalization-related processing).
Further, changes of case SHOULD NOT be done at all and MUST NOT be
done for strings that contain Unicode characters outside the ASCII
range.

In cases in which such strings are sent by the server to the client,
they MAY be presented in either form.  In view
of this, clients that anticipate receiving internationalized
domain names will find it advisable to  convert such strings to
a common form, preferred by the client's users.

A domain name returned by GETATTR will generally
be exactly the same as that presented by SETATTR.   The following
exceptions are possible:


* There is a change of case when the domain string does not
  contain any multi-byte Unicode characters.

* The server converts an xn-label string
  to the corresponding U-label string or vice versa.

For VERIFY and NVERIFY, additional string processing requirements
apply to verification of the owner and owner_group attributes;
see the section entitled "Interpreting owner and owner_group" for
the document specifying the minor version in question
(RFC7530 {{RFC7530}}, RFC8881 {{RFC8881}})

## Effect of IDNA Changes {#OTHER-idna}

Overall, the effect of the shift to IDNA2008  is to limit the
degree of understanding of the IDNA-based restrictions on domain names
that were expected of NFSv4 in RFC7530 {{RFC7530}}.
Despite this specification, the degree to which implementations
actually implemented such restrictions is open to question.  The
consequences of this uncertainty will
be discussed in detail in {{OTHER-compat}}.

In analyzing how various cases are to be dealt with according to
RFC7530, there a number of troubling uncertainties that arise in
trying to interpret the existing specification:


* There are a number of cases in which "SHOULD"
  is used that are
  confusing.  According to RFC2119 {{RFC2119}},
  "SHOULD"
  means that "there may exist valid reasons in particular
  circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full
  implications must be understood and
  carefully weighed before choosing a different course".   To
  fully understand a particular "SHOULD",
  there needs to be enough
  context to determine whether particular reasons for ignoring the
  item are in fact valid, and sufficient guidance to understand
  the implication of ignoring the item.  In the absence of such
  information, the relevant fact is that the peer needs to deal
  with the item being ignored, making the implications of
  a "SHOULD" hard to distinguish from
  those of "MAY".

* While the document states, "the general rules for handling all of
  these domain-related strings are similar and independent of the role
  of the sender or receiver as client or server", all of the following
  text is explicitly about the server's options, choices and
  responsibilities, leaving the client case unclear.

* In a number of places within the paragraph describing server approach
  #1, the word "can" is used as in the text "the
  server can use the ToUnicode function", leaving it unclear whether
  the server can choose to do anything else and if so what.

The following cases are those where RFC7530 requires use of IDNA
handling and this requirement could, if implementations follow them,
create potential compatibility issues, which need to be understood.


* The degree to which RFC3490 {{RFC3490}} requires that
  characters other than U+002E (full stop) be treated as label
  separators, including  U+3002 (ideographic full stop), U+FF0E
  (fullwidth full stop), U+FF61 (halfwidth ideographic full stop).

* The degree to which RFC3490 {{RFC3490}} might
  require that server
  or client needs to validate a putative A-label or U-label or to
  rectify it if it is not valid.


## Potential Compatibility Issues Related to IDNA Changes {#OTHER-compat}

There are a number of factors relating to the handling of domain
names within NFSv4 implementations that are important in
understanding why any compatibility issues might be less troubling
than a comparison of the two IDNA approaches might suggest:


* Much of the potentially conflicting IDNA-related behavior required
  or recommended for the server by RFC7530 {{RFC7530}} appears to not be actually
  implemented, limiting the potential harmful effects of ceasing to
  mandate it.

* Even if such behavior were implemented by servers, no compatibility
  issue would arise unless clients actually relied on the server to
  implement it.   Given that none of this behavior is made
  required, the chances of that occurring is quite small.

* The range of potential values for user and group attributes sent
  by clients are often quite small with implementations commonly
  restricting all such values to a single domain string.  This is even
  though
  RFCs 7530 {{RFC7530}} and 8811 {{RFC8881}} are written without mention of such
  restrictions.

  Specification of users and groups in the "id@domain" format within
  NFSv4 was adopted to enable expansion of the spaces of users and
  groups beyond the 32-bit id spaces mandated in NFSv3 {{RFC1813}} and
  NFsv2 {{RFC1094}}.
  While one obstacle to expansion
  was eliminated, most implementations were unable to actually effect
  that expansion, principally because the underlying file systems used
  assume that user and group identifiers fit in 32 bits each and the
  vnode interfaces used by server implementations make similar
  assumptions.

  Given these restrictions, the typical implementation pattern is
  for servers to accept only a single domain, specified as
  part of the server configuration, together with information
  necessary to effect the appropriate name-to-id mappings.

* For the other uses of domain names in NFSv4, to represent host
  names in
  location attributes, the values are generated by the server and
  will normally only include host names within DNS-registered
  domains.

Keeping the above in mind, we can see that interoperability issues,
while they might exist, are unlikely to raise major challenges as
looking to the following specific cases shows.


* When an internationalized domain name is used as part of a user
  or group, it would need to be configured as such, with the domain
  string known to both client and server.

  While it is theoretically possible that a client might work with
  an invalid domain string and rely on the server to correct it to
  an IDNA-acceptable one, such a scenario has to be considered
  extremely unlikely, since it would depend on multiple servers
  implementing the same correction, especially since there is no
  evidence of such corrections ever having been implemented by
  NFSv4 servers.

* When an internationalized domain in a location string is meant to
  specify a registered domain, similar considerations apply.

  While it is theoretically possible that a client might work with
  an invalid domain string and rely on the server to correct it to
  an appropriate registered one, such a scenario has
  to be considered
  extremely unlikely, since it would depend on multiple servers
  implementing the same correction, especially since there is no
  evidence of such corrections ever having been implemented by
  NFSv4 servers.

* When an internationalized domain in a location string is meant to
  specify a non-registered domain, any such server-applied
  corrections would be useless.

  In this situation, any potential interoperability issue would
  arise from rejecting the name, which has to be considered as
  what should have been done in the first place.



# Errors Related to UTF-8 {#UTF8ERR}

Where the client sends an invalid UTF-8 string, the server MAY return
an NFS4ERR_INVAL error.
This includes cases in which inappropriate prefixes are detected and
where the count includes trailing bytes that do not constitute a full
Multiple-Octet Coded Universal Character Set (UCS) character.

Requirements for server handling of component names that are not
valid UTF-8, when a server does not return NFS4ERR_INVAL in response
to receiving them, are described in {{NONVALID}}.

Where the string supplied by the client is not rejected with
NFS4ERR_INVAL but contains characters that are not supported by that
server as a value for that string (e.g., names containing slashes,
characters that the particular file system are not appropriate in
names, or characters that do not fit into 16 bits when converted from
UTF-8 to a Unicode codepoint), the server MUST indicate such a
rejection using an NFS4ERR_BADCHAR error.

Where a UTF-8 string is used as a file name, and the file
system, while supporting all of the characters within the
name, does not allow that particular name to be used, the
server will return the error NFS4ERR_BADNAME.  This includes
such situations as file system prohibitions of "." and ".."
as file names for certain operations, and similar constraints.

In making such the determinations discussed above, servers
are depending on the character encoding used even when the
encoding using UTF-8 is not enforced.  Since such rejections
are limited to characters whose values are below 128, clients are,
as a practical matter, safe if their encodings are consistent with
UTF-8 in the handling of byte values 127 and below.


# IANA Considerations {#IANA}

The current document does not require any actions by IANA.


# Security Considerations {#SEC}

Unicode in the form of UTF-8 is generally used for file component
names (i.e., both directory and file components).  However,
other character sets may also be allowed for these names.
For the owner and owner_group attributes and other sorts strings
whose form is affected by standards outside NFSv4 (see {{OTHER}}.) are
always encoded as UTF-8.
String processing (e.g., Unicode normalization) raises
security concerns for string comparison.  See
Sections {{<OTHER}} and {{<EQUIV}} as well as the respective
Sections 5.9 of RFC7530 {{RFC7530}} and
RFC8881 {{RFC8881}} for further discussion. See {{RFC6943}} for related
identifier comparison security considerations.  File
component names are identifiers with respect to the identifier
comparison discussion in {{RFC6943}} because they are
sed to identify the objects to which ACLs are applied (See the
respective Sections 6 of RFC7530 {{RFC7530}} and
RFC8881 {{RFC8881}}).

Note that the references to per-minor-version documents
may become out-of-date as part of the rfc5661bis effort.
In the event that happens, it will be necessary for users to
consult RFCs derived from {{I-D.dnoveck-nfsv4-security}} and
{{I-D.dnoveck-nfsv4-acls}}.

# Providing Information about Server Choices Regarding String Equivalence {#INFO}

## Important Issues for Case-insensitive Handling of File Names {#INFO-casei-ex}

In this section, we discuss many of the interesting and/or troublesome
issues that the need for case-insensitive handling gives rise to in
fully internationalized environments.
Many of these are also discussed in {{UNICODE-CASEM}}.
However, our treatment of these issues, while not inconsistent with
that in {{UNICODE-CASEM}}, differs significantly for a number of
reasons:

* Our primary focus is on case-insensitive string comparison rather
  than with case mapping per se.
  While such comparison is natural for the client and allowed for
  servers, its greater flexibility makes it important to understand
  its capabilities in dealing with potentially troublesome issues in
  providing case-insensitive file name handling.

* Because a case mapping model forces the specification of a single
  case mapping result when there are multiple potentially valid results,
  there are inevitably cases in which the result chosen is
  inappropriate for some users.  These are cases in which F-type
  and S-type mappings are present and in which C-type and T-type
  mappings conflict.  Normally, an appropriate choice is selected by
  use of the locale, but in a file system environment, valid locale
  information might not be present.   As a result,
  case-insensitive string
  comparison, which does not force such case mapping choices,
  will be more
  desirable since it allows construction of sets of equivalent
  strings
  based on multiple mappings which is not possible when case
  mapping is the goal.

The examples below present common situations that go beyond the
simple invertible case mappings of Latin characters and the
straightforward
adaptation of that model to Greek and Cyrillic.  In EX4 and EX5
we have case-based sets of equivalent strings including multi-character
strings not derived from canonical equivalences while for EX7 and EX8
all multi-character strings are derived from canonical
equivalences.  In addition, EX1, EX2, EX3 and EX6 discuss other
situations
in which a set of equivalent strings has more than two elements.

{: type="EX%d:"}
1. Certain digraph characters such LATIN SMALL LETTER DZ (U+01F3)
   have additional case variants to consider such as the title case
   character LATIN CAPTAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER Z (U+01F2) in
   addition to the uppercase LATIN CAPITAL LETTER DZ (U+01F1).
   While the variant for title case would not appear in names in
   case-insensitive non-case-preserving file systems, case-insensitive
   string comparison has no problem in treating these three
   characters as within same se of equivalent characters.

    This set of
    equivalent strings can be derived using only C-type mappings.
    The possibility of
    mapping these characters to the two-character sequences they
    represent is not a troublesome
    issue since that would be derived from a compatibility equivalence,
    rather than a canonical equivalence, and there is no F-type
    mapping making it an option.

2. To deal with the case of  the OHM SIGN (U+2126) which is
   essentially identical to the GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9),
   one can construct an set of equivalent characters consisting of OHM
   SIGN (U+2126), GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9), and
   GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA (U+03C9).

   This set of
   equivalent strings can be derived using only C-type mappings.
   Both OHM
   SIGN (U+2126), and GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9)
   lowercase to GREEK  LETTER OMEGA (U+03C9), while that
   character only uppercases to GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9).

3. To deal with the case of the ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B) which is
   essentially identical to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING
   ABOVE (U+00C5), one can construct a set of equivalent
   strings consisting
   of ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B), LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING
   ABOVE (U+00C5), LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH RING
   ABOVE (U+00E5), together with the two-character sequences
   involving LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041) or
   LATIN SMALL LETTER A (U+0061) followed by COMBINING RING
   ABOVE (U+030A).

   This set of
   equivalent strings can be derived using only C-type mappings together
   with the ability to map characters to canonically equivalent
   strings.
   Both ANGSTROM
   SIGN (U+212B), and LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING
   ABOVE (U+00C5) lowercase to LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH RING
   ABOVE (U+00E5), while that character only uppercases to
   CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5).

4. In some cases, case mapping of a single character will result
   in a multi-character string.   For example, the German character
   LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF) would be uppercased to "SS",
   i.e. two copies of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S (U+0053).  On the other
   hand, in some situations, it would be uppercased to
   the character LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (U+1E9E), using an
   S-type mapping, referred to as an instance of "Tailored Casing".
   Unfortunately, in the context of a file system, there is unlikely
   to be available information that provides guidance about which of
   these case mappings should be chosen.   However, the use of
   case-insensitive mappings with larger equivalence classes often
   provides handling that is acceptable to
   a wider variety of users.  In this case, if both mappings were used
   together to create a set of equivalent strings,
   German-speakers would get the
   mapping they expect while those unfamiliar with these characters
   only see them when they access a file whose name contains such
   characters.

   It appears that if the construction of case-based
   equivalence classes were generalized to include multi-character
   sequences, then all of LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF), LATIN
   CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (U+1E9E), "ss", "sS", "Ss", and "SS"
   would belong to the same equivalence class and could be handled
   by the general algorithm described in {{IMPL-casei}},
   rather than by code specifically written to deal with this
   particular issue, which might hard to maintain.

5. Other ligatures, such as LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFL (U+FB04), could
   be handled similarly by this algorithm, if there were felt
   to be a need to do
   so. However, because the decomposition of this character into the
   string consisting of the three letters LATIN SMALL LETTER F (U+0066),
   LATIN SMALL LETTER F (U+0066), LATIN SMALL LETTER L (U+006C),
   is a compatibility equivalence, and the F-type mapping of this
   ligature to the three constituent characters is to be treated
   as optional,
   implementations can choose either to treat this character as
   having no uppercase equivalent or treat it as part of larger
   set of equivalent strings including "ffl", "ffL", "fFl", etc.).

6. The character COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI (U+0345), also known as
   "iota-subscript" requires special handling when uppercasing and
   lowercasing.  While the description of the appropriate handling for
   this character, in the case mapping section, is focused on multi-
   character sequences representing diphthongs, case-insensitive
   comparisons
   can be performed without consideration of multi-character
   sequences.  This can be done by  assigning COMBINING GREEK
   YPOGEGRAMMENI (U+0345), GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA (U+03B9),
   and GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA (U+0399) to the same equivalence
   class, even though the first of these is a combining character
   and the others are not.

7. In some cases, context-dependent case mapping is required.  For
   example, GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3) lowercases to
   GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA (U+03C3) if it is followed by another
   letter and to GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2) if it is not.

   Despite this, case-insensitive comparisons can be
   implemented, by considering
   all of these characters as part of the same equivalence class,
   without any context-dependence, and this set of equivalent
   strings can be
   derived using only
   C-type mappings.

8. In most languages written using Latin characters, the uppercase
   and lowercase varieties of the letter "I" map to one another.
   In a number of Turkic languages, there
   are two distinct characters derived from "I" which differ only
   with regard to the presence or absence of a dot so that
   there are both capital and small i's with each having dotted
   and dotless variants.
   Within such languages, the dotted and dotless I's represent
   different vowel sounds and are treated as separate characters
   with respect to case mapping.  The uppercase
   of LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH
   DOT ABOVE (U+0130), rather than LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049).
   Similarly the lowercase of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) is
   LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131) rather than LATIN SMALL
   LETTER I (U+0069).

   When doing case mapping, the server must choose to uppercase
   LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) to either  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I
   (U+0049), based on a C-type mapping to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I
   WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130), based on a T-type mapping.   The former
   is acceptable to most people but confusing to speakers of the
   Turkic languages in question since the case mapping changes the
   character to represent a different vowel sound.  On the other hand,
   the latter mapping seemingly inexplicably results in a character
   many users have never seen before.  Normally such choices are
   dealt with based on a locale but, in a file system environment,
   no locale information is likely to be available.

   In the context of case-insensitive string comparison, it is
   possible to create a larger set of equivalent strings, including
   all of
   the letters LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069),
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049),
   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130), LATIN SMALL LETTER
   DOTLESS I (U+0131) together with the two-character string consisting
   of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) followed by COMBINING DOT
   ABOVE (U+0307).


## Defining Case-Insensitive Processing of File Names {#INFO-casei-def}

When a server implements case-insensitive file name handling, it
is desirable that clients do so as well.  For example, if a client
possessing the cached contents of a directory, notes that the file
"a" does not exist, it cannot immediately act on that presumed
non-existence, without checking for the potential existence of "A"
as well.  As a result, clients, in order to do certain form of
name caching, might need to be able to provide
case-insensitive name comparisons, irrespective of whether the
server handling is case-preserving or not.

Because case-insensitive name comparisons are not always as
straightforward
as the above example suggests, the client, if it is to emulate
the server's name handling, would need information about how certain
cases are to be dealt with.  In cases in which that information is
unavailable, the client needs to avoid making assumptions about the
server's handling, since it will be unaware of the Unicode version
implemented by the server, or many of the details of specific issues
that might need to be addressed differently by different server
file systems in implementing
case-insensitive name handling.

Many of the problematic issues with regard to the case-insensitive
handling of names are discussed in Section 5.18 of the Unicode
Standard {{UNICODE-CASEM}} which deals with case mapping.
While we need to address all of these issues as well, our approach
will not be exactly the same.

* Since the client would only need to be doing case-insensitive
  comparisons,
  issues
  that apply only to uppercasing or lowercasing do not have the same
  significance.

* Many clients will have to operate correctly even in the absence
  of detailed information about the specifics of server-side
  case-mapping
  or the version of Unicode implemented by the server.

* Clients will have to accommodate server behaviors not anticipated
  by the Unicode Specification since it might be that neither the server
  nor the
  client would have any relevant
  locale knowledge when file names are processed.

Another source of information about case-folding, and indirectly about
case-insensitive comparisons, is the case-folding text file which
is part of the Unicode Standard {{UNICODE-CASEF}}.
This file contains, for each Unicode character that can be uppercased
or lowercased, a single character, or, in some cases a string of
characters of the other case.  For characters in capital case, the
lowercase counterpart is given.   Each of the mappings is characterized
as of one of four types:


* Common case folding, denoted by a status field of "C".  These
  are used for mapping where a single character can be mapped to
  a single character of another case.  These are always valid
  with one potential exception being the mappings of LATIN CAPITAL
  LETTER I to LATIN SMALL LETTER I and vice versa, which might be
  superseded by the T-type mappings associated with
  some Turkic languages when written using Latin letters.

* Full case folding, denoted by a status field of "F".  These are
  used for mappings in which single character is mapped to a
  multi-character string of a different case.

* Special case folding, denoted by a status field of "S".  These
  provide additional single-character-to-single-character which
  might be used when there is also an F-type mapping of
  the same character.  In the case of case folding, this is an
  alternative to the corresponding F-type, although, for the purposes
  of case-insensitive string comparison, it is possible for both to
  be considered valid at the same time

* Special case foldings for Turkic languages, denoted by a status
  field of "T".  These consist of the invertible case mappings between
  LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) and LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE
  (U+0130) and between LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) and LATIN
  SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).  The relationship between these
  mappings and the C-type mappings for LETTER I is discussed below in
  item EX8.

While the case mapping section does discuss case-insensitive string
comparisons,
and describes a procedure for constructing equivalence classes of
Unicode characters, the description does not deal clearly with
the effect of F-type mappings.  There are a number of problems with
dealing with F-type mappings for case folding and basing
case-insensitive string comparisons on
those mappings, particularly in
situations, such as file systems, in which extensive processing of
strings is unlikely to be practical.


* Mappings from single characters to multi-character strings, are,
  for case-folding purposes, not invertible.  However, case-insensitive
  name comparison, by its nature, requires invertible mappings, in
  which a multi-character string is mapped to a single character of
  a different case.  This is not compatible with any existing simple
  case-mapping model.

* Scanning of names for multi-character sequences might well be too
  complicated for effective implementation within a file system,
  especially since such sequences might overlap in
  complicated ways.

* Case foldings which map single characters to multi-character
  sequences (see item EX4 below for an important example), would
  give rise to very large sets of strings.  This is because of the
  invertibility of case mappings when
  used to determine case-insensitive string equivalence.
  For example, a string of eight copies
  of the letter S would give rise to a set of 256 equivalent
  strings plus over two thousand
  others when the German SHARP S characters discussed
  in item EX4 are included.

Despite these potential difficulties, case mappings involving
multi-character sequences can be reversed when used as a basis for
case-insensitive string comparisons and incorporated into
a set of equivalence classes on name strings, as described below.


* Case-insensitive servers MAY do either case-mapping to a chosen
  case (the non-case-preserving case),
  or case-insensitive string comparisons when providing a
  case-preserving
  implementation.  In either case, the server MAY include F-type mappings,
  which map a single character to a multi-character string.   However,
  only the case in which it is doing case-insensitive string
  comparison will
  it use the inverse of F-type mappings, in which a multi-character
  string is mapped to a single character of a different case

  In these cases, the server can choose to use either a C-type mapping
  or an F-type mapping, or both, when both exist.  Similarly
  the server may choose to implement the C-type mappings of LATIN
  CAPITAL LETTER I to LATIN SMALL LETTER I and vice versa, the
  corresponding T-type mappings or both, although using only
  the T-type mappings is undesirable,
  unless there is a means of informing the client that
  it has been chosen, since users might reasonably expect
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I and LATIN SMALL LETTER I to treated
  identically in a case-insensitive file system.

* The client, when informed of the details of the client's handling
  of case, has the ability to efficiently implement an appropriate
  case-insensitive name comparison compatible with that of the
  server.  This includes the ability to handle mappings between
  single characters and multi-character strings.

* Implementation of case-insensitive name comparisons will typically
  require a case-insensitive name hash.


## Providing Information about Server Case-Insensitive Comparisons {#INFO-casei}

It is possible to provide, as part of a valid NFSv4 extension,
information sufficient to allow the client to be aware of, and
potentially to emulate, case-insensitive comparisons implemented by
the server.
Such information would take the form of an OPTIONAL read-only per-fs
file attribute.
The information listed below would need to be included.

Whenever the value provided for a particular file system is invalid in
some way, the client is justified in ignoring the attribute and
acting as if it were not supported on that file system


* An integer denoting the version of Unicode on which the
  implemented case-equivalence relation was based.

  The value zero would be available for use to indicate that
  the version is not relevant, either because the file system
  in question is UTF8-unaware, or because there is no
  server processing based on this version  when the server is not
  case-insensitive and does not provide any normalization-related
  services.

  If the value zero is received on a case-insensitive file system,
  the
  attribute value is considered invalid.

* Information regarding the special mapping for languages in
  which dot and dotless i's represent different vowel sounds
  (e.g. Turkish and Azeri).

  This could take the form of an enumeration having the
  values listed below, with any other value causing the
  attribute to be considered invalid.

  * A value indicating that only the C-type mapping are to be used
    in handling all i characters.

    In the case, LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) and
    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) are considered case-equivalent
    while neither LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130)
    nor LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131) are considered
    case-equivalent to any other character.

  * A value indicating that only the T-type mappings are to be used
    in handling all i characters.

    In this case, LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131) is
    considered case-equivalent to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049)
    while neither LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) nor
    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130) are considered
    case-equivalent to any other character.

  * A value indicating that both C-type and T-type mappings are
    to be used when handling i character.

    This value must not be used for file system
    that are case-insensitive but not case-preserving.

    In this case, all of LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069),
    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049),
    LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131), and
    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130) are considered
    case-equivalent.

* Handling for special and full case foldings, as described
  in {{INFO-casei-def}}.

  This might take the form of a variable-length array of item
  of charfoldtype4, one for each character that can be subject
  to either S-type or F-type mappings.  A possible realization
  of this type is described below.  If this array is not of
  length zero and the Unicode version is zero, the attribute is
  considered invalid.

Each charfoldtype4 would contain the following:


* The numeric value of the UCS character, as opposed to the UTF-8
  encoding of that character.

  If the character is one that has neither an S-type nor an
  F-type mapping, the attribute is considered invalid.

* A word with two bits,  each of which indicates whether one of the
  two types of mapping are to be used in constructing sets of
  equivalent strings, with the low-order bit referring
  to S-type mappings and the next bit referring to F-type
  mappings.  Depending on these bit settings, these mappings
  are either included or not in the set of case-equivalent strings
  associated with the particular character on the current
  the file system. This is in addition to any equivalences
  resulting from C-type mappings

  When either of these bits is set and the specified mapping does
  not exist for the associated character, the attribute is
  considered invalid.

If there are characters within the specified Unicode version
that have S-type or F-type mappings specified and are not included
in the array, then the equivalence set
memberships for that character depend only on C-type
mappings, if present.


## Providing Information about Server Form-Insensitive Comparisons {#INFO-norm}

It is possible to provide, as part of a valid NFSv4 extension,
information sufficient to allow the client to be aware of, and
potentially to emulate, form-insensitive comparisons implemented by
the server.
Such information would take the form of an OPTIONAL read-only per-fs
file attribute.
The following information would need to be included.

* An integer denoting the version of Unicode on which the
  implemented canonical equivalence was based.

  The value zero would be available for use to indicate that
  the version is not relevant, either because the file system
  in question is UTF8-unaware, or because there is no
  server processing based on the canonical equivalence relation.

* An enumerated value indicates whether names are mapped to their
  NFC or NFD equivalents, or compared in a form-insensitive manner
  without modification.

Although the attribute discussed in {{INFO-casei}} contains the Unicode
version, allowing this one to be dispensed with, it is defined
separately for the following reasons:

* Because of the additional effort in defining an attribute
  capable of supporting case-insensitivity and the low level
  of interest in that feature, the Working Group might decide
  to define this one first.

* Even when they were both defined some servers might choose
  not to support the one only applicable to a case-insensitive
  environment.



# Implementation Discussions {#IMPL}

## Implementing Case-Insensitive Comparison of File Names {#IMPL-casei}

Implementing case-insensitive string comparisons based on equivalence
classes including multi-character strings can be performed as
described below.  When such case-based set of equivalent strings
contain
multi-character strings, there are potential complexities that
derive from the need to recognize such multi-character strings within
the strings being compared.

The algorithm presented in this section requires the following for
each set of equivalent strings:


{: type="(%d):"}
1. That if there is more
   than one multi-character string within the set of equivalent
   strings, the equivalence of those strings must be
   derivable from case-insensitive string
   equivalence using sets of equivalent strings each of whose
   members consist only of single-character strings.

2. That each such set contains at least one single-character
   string.

Although other sources are possible (see items EX2 and EX3 in
{{INFO-casei-ex}}), an important reason that
multi-character sequences appear in case-insensitive
sets of equivalent strings result from
canonical decomposition of one or more precomposed characters.
In such cases, elements of a case-insensitive
equivalence class will include multiple characters because of the
canonical decomposition of a single character.

While the algorithm presented in this section can deal with
certain case-based equivalences deriving from canonical decomposition,
it is not capable of providing general handling of the combination
of canonical equivalence and case-based equivalence.   While this can
be addressed by normalizing strings before doing case-insensitive
comparison, it is more efficient to do a general form-insensitive
and case-insensitive string comparison in a single step as described
in {{IMPL-formi}}.

The following tables would be used by the comparison algorithm
presented below.


* For each possible character value, the associated set of equivalent
  strings for case-insensitive comparison would be identified

* For each such set, the hash value contribution will
  be provided.  In the case of set of equivalent strings that do
  not include
  multi-character strings including set that only
  include a
  single (single-character) member, this will be the hash
  value contribution of one
  particular variant (usually lower case) of the character

* In the case of set of equivalent string that do include
  multi-character
  strings, the hash value contribution needs to be equivalent to the
  combined contribution of each character within the multi-character
  string.  In addition, for each such equivalence class, the
  length of the multicharacter string will be provided together with a
  pointer to an array describing the multi-character string, most
  probably presenting each character by a value of a case-equivalent
  character, most probably the lower-case variant.

Case-insensitive comparison proceeds as follows:


* Implementation of case-insensitive name comparisons will typically
  require a case-insensitive name hash using the tables described
  above.   If such a hash value is kept for all cached names,
  comparisons
  of hashes can be used instead of the detailed comparison set forth
  below.  Using such hash comparisons, a large set of potentially
  equivalent names
  can be excluded based on the occurrence of hash mismatches, since
  case-equivalent names would have the same hash value.

* For names with matching hash values, a detailed case-insensitive
  comparison will be necessary.   This can proceed character-by-
  character or byte-by-byte.  However, in the byte-by-byte case,
  processing in the event of a mismatch must start at the start
  of the current character, rather than the byte at which the
  difference was detected.

* In cases in which there is a mismatch, the associated equivalence
  classes will be compared.  When these are identical, indicating the
  case equivalence of the two characters, the comparison of the two
  strings continues at the next character of each string.

* When the two equivalence classes are not identical, further
  comparisons to determine if a single character within one
  string matches (except for case) a multi-character string
  within the other.  For
  each of two equivalence classes being compared that include
  a multi-character string, the check below must be made to determine
  whether the multi-character string at the corresponding position
  of the other string being compared, is within the
  current equivalence class.   If neither of the two equivalence
  classes include multi-character strings, the comparison terminates
  with a mismatch indication.

* For each equivalence class that does include a multi-character
  string (there might be one or two), a scan needs to be made to see
  of the characters at the current position if the other string
  matches (except for case) the multi-character string which
  is included in the current equivalence class.  If this check
  succeeds, for either equivalence class, the comparison of the two
  strings continues at the next character of each string.  In the
  event of failure, the same sort of comparison is done using the
  other current equivalence class, if it include multi-character
  strings.  Once this check fails for all equivalence classes that
  include multi-character strings, the comparison terminates with a
  mismatch indication.


## Form-insensitive String Comparisons {#IMPL-formi}

This section deals with two varieties of form-insensitive string
comparison:


* Providing a comparison function which is form-insensitive only.  For
  any string, whether normalized or not, this function will determine it
  to be equivalent to all canonically equivalent strings,
  including but not
  limited, to the normalized forms NFC and NFD

* Providing a comparison function which is both form-insensitive and
  case-insensitive.  This function will determine strings that only
  differ in case to be equal but will also be form-insensitive, as
  described above.

The non-normative guidance provided in this Appendix is intended to
be helpful in dealing with two distinct implementation areas:


* Implementation of server-side file systems intended to be accessed
  as UTF8-aware file systems
  using NFSv4 protocols.   While it is often the case that such
  file systems are developed by separate organizations from those
  concerned with NFSv4 server development, the internationalization-
  related requirements specified in this document must be adhered to
  for successful inter-operation when using UTF8-aware file systems,
  making this implementation guidance
  apropos despite any potential organizational barriers.

* Implementation of NFSv4 clients that might need to provide matching
  internationalization-related handling for reason discussed in
  {{EQUIV-clcache}}.

There are three basic reasons that two strings being compared
might be canonically equivalent even though not identical. For
each such reason, the implementation will be similar in the
cases in which form-insensitive comparison (only) is being done
and in which the comparison is both case-insensitive and form-
insensitive.


* Two strings may differ only because each has a different one of two
  code points that are essentially the same. Three code points
  assigned to represent units, are essentially equivalent to the
  character denoting those units.  For example, the OHM SIGN (U+2126)
  is essentially identical to the GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9)
  as MICRO SIGN (U+00B5) is to GREEK SMALL LETTER MU (U+03BC) and
  ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B) is to
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5).

  As discussed in items EX2 and EX3 in {{INFO-casei-ex}}, it
  is possible to adjust for this situation using tables designed to
  resolve case-insensitive equivalence, essentially treating the
  unit symbols as an additional case variant, essentially
  ignoring the fact that the
  graphic representation is the same.  As a result, those doing string
  comparisons that are both form-insensitive and case-insensitive do
  not need to address this issue as part of form-insensitivity, since
  it would be dealt with by existing case-insensitive comparison logic.

  Where there is no case-insensitive comparison logic, this function
  needs to be performed using similar tables whose primary function
  is to provide the decomposition of precomposed characters, as
  described in {{FORMI-table}}.

* Two strings may differ in that one has the decomposed form
  consisting of a base
  character and an associated combining character while the other has
  a precomposed character equivalent.

  Although, as discussed in items EX3 in {{INFO-casei-ex}},
  it is possible to use tables designed to resolve case-insensitive
  equivalence by providing as possible case-insensitively equivalent
  string, multi-character string providing the decomposition of
  precomposed characters, special logic to do so is only necessary
  when the decomposition is not a canonical one, i.e. it is a
  compatibility equivalence.

  In general, the table used to do comparisons, whether case-sensitive
  or not, needs to provide information about the canonical
  decomposition of precomposed characters.  See {{FORMI-table}} for details.

* Two strings may differ in that the strings consist of
  combining characters that have the same effect differ as to the
  order in which the characters appear.  For example, a letter
  might be followed by a combining character above and a combining
  character below and the combining characters might appear in
  different orders.

  There is no way this function could be performed within code
  primarily devoted to case-insensitive equivalence.  However, this
  function could be added to implementations, providing both sorts of
  equivalence once it is determined that the base characters are
  case-equivalent while there is a difference of combining characters
  in to be resolved.
  (See {{FORMI-combining}} for a discussion of how sets of combining
  characters can be compared).

### Name Hashes {#FORMI-hash}

We discussed in {{IMPL-casei}} the construction of a
case-insensitive file name hash.   While such a hash could also
be form-insensitive if the hash contribution of every
pre-composed character matched the combined contribution of the
characters that it decomposes into.

However, there is no obvious way that sort of hash could respect
the canonical equivalence of multiple combining characters
modifying the same base character, when those combining
characters appear in different orders.  Addressing that issue
would require a significantly different sort of hash, in which
combining characters are treated differently from others, so that
the re-ordering of a string of combining characters applying to the
same base character will not affect the hash.

In the hash discussed in {{IMPL-casei}}, there is no
guarantee that the hash for multiple combining characters
presented in different orders will be the same.   This is because
typically such hashes implement some transformation on the
existing hash, together with adding the new character to the hash
being accumulated.  Such methods of hash construction will
arrive at different values if
the ordering of combining characters changes.

In order to create a hash with the necessary characteristics, one can
construct a separate sub-hash for composite character, consisting
of one non-combining character (may be pre-composed) together with the
set (possibly null) of combining characters immediately following it.
Each such composed character, whether precomposed or not, will have
its own sub-hash, which will be the same regardless of the order of
the combining characters.

If the hash is to include case-insensitivity, special handling is
needed to deal with issues arising from the handling of
COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI (U+0345).   That combining character, as
discussed in item EX6 of {{INFO-casei-ex}} is uppercased to
the non-combining character GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA (U+0399) which is
in turn lowercased to the non-combining character GREEK SMALL
LETTER IOTA (U+03B9).  As a result,  when computing a case-insensitive
hash, when a base character is IOTA (of either case) and the previous
base character is ALPHA, ETA, or OMEGA (of the same case as the IOTA),
that IOTA is treated, for the purpose of defining the composite
characters for which to generate sub-hashes as if it were a combining
character.  As a result, in this case a string of containing two
composite characters will be treated as were a single
composite character since the iota will be treated as if it were a
combining character.   This string will have its own sub-hash, which
will be the same regardless of the order of combining characters.

The same outline will be followed for generating hashes which are
to be form-insensitive (only) and for those which are to be both
form-insensitive and case-insensitive. The initial value, representing
the base character, will differ based on the type of hash, as
discussed below.


* In the case-sensitive case, the initial value of the sub-hash
  will reflect the value of the base character with the only possible
  need to map to a different value deriving from the existence of
  OHM SIGN (U+2126), ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B), and MICRO SIGN (U+00B5)
  as characters distinct from the letters that represent these code
  points.
  This could be done with a mapping table but most implementations
  would probably choose to implement special-purpose code to do this.

* In the case-insensitive case, the initial value of the sub-hash
  will reflect the case-based equivalence class to which the
  character (the lower-case equivalent is generally suitable). In
  this context a table-based mapping is required and this mapping
  can shift OHM SIGN, ANGSTROM SIGN, and MICRO SIGN to the case-based
  equivalence class for the corresponding character.

Regardless of the type of hash to be produced, values based on the
following combining characters need to reflected in the sub-hash.
In order to make the sub-hash invariant to changes in the order of
combining characters, values based on the particular combining
character are combined with the hash being computed using a commutative
associative operation, such as addition.

To reduce false-positives, it is desirable to make the hash relatively
wide (i.e. 32-64 bits) with the value based on base character in the
upper portion of the word with the values for the combining
characters appearing in a wide range of bit positions in the rest
of the word to limit the degree that multiple distinct sets of
combining characters have value that are the same.  Although the details
will be affected by processor cache structure and the distribution
of names processed, a
table of values will be used but typical implementations will be
different in the two cases we are dealing as described in {{FORMI-table}}.

As each sub-hash is computed, it is combined into a name-wide hash.
There is no need for this computation to be order-independent and it
will probably include a circular shift of the hash computed so far
to be added to the contribution of the sub-hash for the new base
or composed character.

As described in {{FORMI-outline}} the appropriate
full name hash will have the major role in excluding potential
matches efficiently.  However, in some small number of cases, there
will be a hash match in which the names to be compared are not
equivalent, requiring more involved processing.   It is assumed below
that a given name will be searching for potential cached matches
within the directory so that for that name, on will be able retain
information used to construct the full name hash (e.g. individual
sub-hashes plus the bounds of each composite character.   These will
be compared against cached entries where only the full (e.g. 64-bit)
name hash and the name itself will be available for comparison.


### Character Tables {#FORMI-table}

The per-character tables used in these algorithms have a number
of type of entries for different types of characters.   In some
cases, information for a given character type will be essentially
the same whether the comparison is to be form-insensitive or case-
insensitive.   In others, there will be differences.  Also, there
may be entry types that only exist for particular types of
comparisons.   In any case, some bits within the table entry will
be devoted to representing the type of character and entry, with
provisions for the following cases:


* For combining characters, the entry will provide information
  about the character's contribution to the composite character
  sub-hash in which it appears.

* For case-insensitive comparisons, there needs to be special
  entries for characters, which, while not themselves combining
  characters, are the case-insensitive equivalents of combining
  characters.   An example of this situation is provided in item
  EX6 within {{INFO-casei-ex}}.

* For pre-composed characters, the entry needs to provide the initial
  hash value which is to be the basis for the sub-hash for the
  name substring including contributions for the base character
  together with contribution of included combining characters.
  In addition, such entries will provide, separately, information
  about the character's canonical decomposition.

* For case-insensitive comparisons, there needs to be,
  for base characters, entries assigning each base character to
  the case-based equivalence class to which it belongs, although
  such entries can be avoided if the equivalence class matches
  the character (usually caseless and lowercase characters.

* Also, for case-insensitive comparisons, there will need
  to be special entries for characters which multi-character
  string as case-insensitive equivalent of the base character.
  Examples of this situation are provided in items EX4 and EX5
  within {{INFO-casei-ex}}.   Such entries will need to
  have a hash-contribution that reflects the hash that would be
  computed for the multi-character string.

* For form-insensitive comparisons, there will be special
  entries to provide special handling for those cases in which
  there are two canonically equivalent single characters.  Such entries
  do not exist for case-insensitive comparison since this situation
  can be handled by a non-standard use of
  case mapping for base characters by placing these two characters
  in the same case-based equivalence

In the common case in which a two-stage mapping will be used,
there will be common groups of characters in which no table entry
will be required, allowing a default entry type to be used for some
character groups with entry
contents easily calculable from the code point.


* In the case form-insensitive comparison, this consists of all
  base characters, with the hash contribution of the character
  derivable by a pre-specified transformation of the code point value.

* In the case case-insensitive comparison, this consists of all
  base character which are either caseless or equivalence class
  is the same as the code point, typically lowercase characters.
  As in the form-insensitive case, the hash contribution of the
  character is derivable by a pre-specified transformation of the
  code point value, which matches, in this case, the id assigned
  to the case-based equivalence class.




### Outline of comparison {#FORMI-outline}

We are assuming that comparisons will be based on the hash values
computed as described in {{FORMI-hash}}, whether the
comparison is to be form-insensitive or both case-insensitive and
form-insensitive.

To facilitate this comparison, the name hash will be stored with the
names to be compared.
As a result, when there is a need to investigate a new name and
whether there are existing matches, it will be possible to search for
matches with existing names cached for that directory, using a hash
for the new name which is computed and compared to all the existing
names, with the result that the detailed comparisons described in
Appendices {{<FORMI-base}} and {{<FORMI-combining}} have to be done
relatively rarely, since non-matching names together with matching
hashes are likely to be atypical.

Given the above, it is a reasonable assumption, which we will take
note of in the sections below, that for one of the names to be
compared, we will have access to data generated in the process of
computing the name hash while for the other names, such data would
have to be generated anew, when necessary.  When that data includes,
as we expect it will, the offset and length of the string regions
covered by each sub-hash, direct byte-by-byte comparisons between
corresponding regions of the two strings can exclude the possibility
of difference without invoking any detailed logic to deal with
the possibility of canonical equivalence or case-based equivalence
in the absence of identical name segment.

In the case in which the byte-by-byte comparisons fail, further
analysis is necessary:


* First, the associated base characters are compared, as is discussed
  in {{FORMI-base}}.   When doing form-insensitive
  comparison this is straightforward.  However, when case-insensitive
  comparison is to be done, there is the possibility that the
  sub-hash boundaries of the two comparands are different, requiring
  that a common point in both comparands be found to resume
  comparison after a successful match.   For either form of
  comparison, if a mismatch is found at this point then the
  comparison fails, while, if there is match, there must be a
  comparison of any following combining characters, as described
  below, before moving on to the region covered by the appropriate
  sub-string covered by the appropriate next sub-hash for each
  comparand.

* If there is no mismatch as to the base characters, the set of
  associated combining characters (might be null) must be compared,
  as is discussed in {{FORMI-combining}}.  If a mismatch
  is found at this point then the comparison fails.  This may be
  because the sets of combining characters are different, because there
  are multiple copies of the same combining character in one of the
  string, or because the difference in combining character is not one
  that maintains canonical equivalence (due to combining classes).

* When both comparisons show a match, the comparison resumes at the
  next substring, using a byte-by-byte comparison initially.  If the
  comparison cannot be resumed because one of the strings is
  exhausted, the comparison terminate, succeeding only if both
  strings are exhausted while failing if only one of the strings
  is exhausted.


### Comparing Base Characters {#FORMI-base}

In general, the task of comparing based characters is simple, using
a table lookup using the numeric value of the initial character in
the substring.   When doing form-insensitive comparison this is the
base character associated with the initial (possibly pre-composed)
character, while for case-insensitive comparison it is the case-based
equivalence class associated with that character.

When doing case-insensitive comparison, issues may arise that result
when there is a multi-character string that as the case- insensitive
equivalent of a single base character, as discussed in items EX4 and
EX5 within {{INFO-casei-ex}}.
These are best dealt with using the approach outlined in {{IMPL-casei}}.
When it is noted that the current base character (for either
comparand) is a character whose associated equivalence class contains
one or more multi-character strings, then these comparisons, normally
requiring that each base character be mapped to the same case-based
equivalence class be modified to allow equivalences allowed by these
multi-character sequences.

In such cases, there may need to be comparisons involving the
multi-character string, in addition to the normal comparisons
using the base characters' equivalence class.   As an illustration,
we will consider possible comparison results that involve
characters string within the equivalence class mentioned in item
EX4 within {{INFO-casei-ex}}.


* When the base character for both comparands are either
  LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF) or LATIN
  CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (U+1E9E), then a match is recognized.

* When the base character for one comparand is either
  LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF) or LATIN
  CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (U+1E9E), while the other is not,
  each character in the that other comparand is case-insensitively
  compared to the corresponding character of the string "ss" with
  a match being signaled when all such subsequent characters match,
  except for possibly being of a different case.  Because that
  comparison will involve multiple base characters, the overall
  comparison point for that comparand will have to be adjusted to
  reflect character already processed as part of the comparison.

* When the base character for neither comparands is either
  LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF) or LATIN
  CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (U+1E9E), then matching proceeds
  normally.   As a result, the only cases in which character strings
  within the equivalence class being discussed will result is
  where both comparands have one of the strings "ss", "sS", "Ss", or
  "SS" at the current comparison point.


### Comparing Combining Characters {#FORMI-combining}

In order to effect the necessary comparison, one needs to assemble,
for each comparand, the set of combining characters within the
current substring.   The means used might be different for different
comparands since there
might be useful information retained from the generation of the
associated string hash for one of the comparands.  In any case,
there are two potential sources for these characters:


* Those deriving from the canonical decomposition of a pre-composed
  character, treated as a null set of if the base character is
  not a precomposed one.

* Those combining characters that immediately follow the base
  character, which will be a null set if the immediately following
  character is not a combining character.
  Note that it is possible, when doing case-insensitive comparison to
  treat certain character, not normally combining characters, as if
  they are.
  Such situations can arise, when, as described in item EX6 within
  {{INFO-casei-ex}}, such non-combining character are the uppercase or
  lowercase equivalents of combining characters.

Although, the two sets of character can be checked to see if they are
identical, this is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for
equivalence since some permutations of a set of combining
characters are considered canonically equivalent.  To summarize
the appropriate equivalence rules:


* Combining characters of different combining classes may be
  freely reordered.

* If combining characters of the same combining class are reordered,
  then result is not canonically equivalent

The rules above do not directly apply to the case, discussed above,
in which some non-combining characters are the case-based equivalents
of combining characters such as COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI
(U+0345).   Nevertheless, because of this equivalence, those
implementing case-insensitive comparisons do have to deal with this
potential equivalence when considering whether two strings containing
combining characters or their case-based equivalents match.  As a
result when comparing strings of combining characters, we need to
implement the following modified rules.


* When one comparand has a true combining character and the other
  comparand has an identical one, they may differ in location as
  long as there is no permutation of combining characters of the
  same combining class.

* When one comparand has a true combining character and the other
  has a case-insensitive equivalent which is not a combining
  character, that character must appear last in its string
  while the combining may character appear in its string in any
  position except the last.  In this case, there are no
  restrictions based on combining classes.

* When both comparands contain a non-combining character
  case-insensitively equivalent to a combining character, these
  character must appear last in their respective strings.

Although it is possible to divide combining characters based
on their combining
classes, sort each of the list and compare, that approach will not
be discussed here.  Even though the use of sorts might allow use
of an overall N log N algorithm, the number of combining characters
is likely to be too low for this to be a practical benefit.
Instead, we present below an order N-squared algorithm based on
searches.

In this algorithm, one string, chosen arbitrarily, is designated the
"source string" and successive characters from it, are searched for
in the other, designated the "target string".  Associated with the
target string is a mask to allow characters search for a found to
be marked so that they will not be found a second time.  In the
treatment below, when a character is "searched for" only characters
not yet in the mask are examined and the character sought has its
associated mask bit set when it is found.

Each character in the source string is processed in turn with the
actual processing depending on particular character being processed,
with the following three possibilities to be dealt with.


1. For the typical case (i.e. a combining character with no case-
   insensitive equivalents), the character is searched for in the
   target string with the compare failing if it is not found.

   If it is found, then the region of the target string between
   the point corresponding to the current position in the source
   string and the character found is examined to check for
   characters of the same combining class.   If any are found, the
   overall comparison fails.

2. For the case of a combining character with a case-
   insensitive equivalents, the character is searched for as
   described in the first paragraph of item 1.  However, the
   compare does not fail if it is not found.
   Instead, a case-insensitive equivalent character is searched for
   at the final position of the string and the compare fails if that
   is not found.

3. For the case of a non-combining character that has a combining
   character as a case-insensitive equivalents, the overall comparison
   fails if the character is not in the final position within the source
   string or has already been successfully searched for.  Otherwise,
   the corresponding
   combining character is searched for in the target as described in
   in the first paragraph of item 1.  The overall compare fails if it
   is not found.

Once all characters in the source string has been processed, the mask
associated is examined to see if there are combining character that
were not found in the matching process described above.
Normally, if there
are such characters, the overall comparison fails.   However, if the
last character of the target was not matched and if it is a
non-combining character that is case-insensitively equivalent to a
combining character, then comparison succeeds and the remaining
character needs to be matched with the next substring in the source.



## Optimization of Form-Insensitive Comparisons {#IMPL-opt}

This section will discuss situations in which form-independent
comparisons, for certain groups of strings, can be done in a
more efficient manner than described in {{IMPL-formi}}.

One important group of strings is those in which all of the
characters consist of a single byte. We call these strings
the UTF8-onebyte subset. A string's membership in this subset can
be easily determined as part of UTF8-compliance checking,
hash generation, or a preliminary byte-by-byte comparison to a
string whose membership status in this subset is already known.

As a result, there are many situations in which a form-independent
string comparison can be done without reference to detailed character
tables or any UTF8-to-UCS conversions. Examples follow:


* If the current file system is case-sensitive and either of two
  strings being compared are a member of the UTF8-onebyte subset
  the result of a byte-by-byte comparison of the two strings can
  be accepted as definitive without any reference to the details
  of the particular canonical equivalence relation used.

  When neither of the strings being compared are a member of the
  UTF8-onebyte subset, there are further opportunities for optimized
  comparisons, discussed below.

  This applies regardless of the particular Unicode version used.

* If the current file system is case-insensitive and the handling of
  case equivalence is such that LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069),
  and LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) are considered equivalent,
  then, when both of the strings being compared are members of
  UTF8-onebyte subset, a positive result for the comparison can be
  immediately accepted but a negative result,
  need to be supplemented by simple version of case-insensitive
  comparison
  using a 127-byte table mapping each letter to other-case
  equivalent.  If this succeeds the strings are equivalent, while,
  if it does not, all the complexities of form-insensitive string
  comparisons need to be taken account of.

  This applies regardless of the particular Unicode version used.

* If the current file system is case-insensitive and the handling of
  case equivalence is such that either LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069),
  and LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) are not considered equivalent,
  or the handling of these characters is unknown (client only) than a
  variant of the above can be used.

  In this variant, when a byte-by-byte comparison results in a
  negative result, a byte-by-byte comparison still needs to be
  done but the mapping table used is different in that it does not
  map LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) and
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) to each other but maps each
  character to itself as it does for characters that have no case.

When the procedures above are not usable, further opportunities
for optimized handling depend on case-sensitivity. For case-sensitive
file systems, there are optimized approaches to name comparisons
that can be used when either or both of the names being compared
is not a member of the UTF8-onebyte subset.

The alternative allows a byte-by-byte comparison to be used for
name comparison if at least one of the names belong to the
canonical-singleton subset of strings, defined as those strings
that are known to have no canonically equivalent strings.
Two important facts, which implementations can take advantage of,
are the following:


* The UTF8-onebyte subset is contained within the canonical-singleton
  subset.

  This fact can be taken advantage of when one of the two string to
  be compared is a member of the UTF8-onebyte subset, so no further
  checking is necessary in this case.  As a result additional testing
  for membership in the canonical-singleton subset only needs to be
  done when neither of the two strings is a member of the
  UTF8-onebyte subset.

* This set can be usefully defined without reference to the particular
  version of Unicode to be used.  This allows this set to be used
  by clients in testing names for suitability for negative name
  caching, as described in {{IMPL-cache}}.

  The set of characters can be defined as all the characters defined
  in a relatively early version of Unicode with certain exclusions,
  excluding characters which are the NFC form of some string, combining
  characters, defined as those ever present within some NFD form of
  a one-character string, together with OHM SIGN (U+2126).

  This set does not have to be changed with new Unicode versions,
  since, while it possible for them to add new characters to this set
  it is impossible to remove them since that would require converting
  a previously-existing character to be a combining character or
  given it a new decomposition which is impossible.

Implementations are likely to implement a test for strings in the
canonical-singleton subset, limited to strings which are limited
to strings whose UTF-8 encoding includes no character requiring
more than two bytes to encode.   In testing for membership in this
subset one-but character can be ignored and two-byte character
need to checked against a 240-byte read-only bitmap whose bytes are
likely to be available quite quickly in processor caches.


## Restricted Client Caching to Deal with Name Equivalences {#IMPL-cache}

Given the name caching difficulties mentioned in {{EQUIV-clcache}} and
the typical lack of information regarding the details many clients
will want to limit name caching as described in that section.
However, there might be situations in which other approaches are
desirable and we discuss the issues below:

* For case-sensitive file systems, name which are in the
  canonical-singleton subset can effectively cached, so
  clients could use the full-range of name-caching techniques
  for such names, even the absence of detailed information
  about the canonical equivalence relation being used.

  There is overhead added by this check on the client,
  since, unlike the server case, there is no opportunity to
  combine this check with validation of UTF-8 encoding.
  Nevertheless, that overhead is quite small so it is likely
  that clients will implement it for UTF8-aware file system that
  are case-sensitive, rather than living with restricted name
  caching, as described in {{EQUIV-clcache}}.

* For case-insensitive file systems, the situation is different.
  Even for the UTF8-onebyte subset, the possibilities of unexpected
  equivalence due to issues with dotted and dotless i, sharp s,
  and various ligatures means that simple case-based equivalences
  cannot be assumed.

  As a result, clients handling case-insensitive file systems
  are most likely to simply avoid potentially troublesome
  forms of name caching, unless full information on the equivalence
  relation is available.  In the case that it is available, all
  forms of name caching would be possible, but that requires the
  implementation on the client of the comparison methods described
  in {{IMPL-formi}} together with the potential
  optimizations discussed in {{IMPL-opt}}.



# History {#HIST}

This section describes the history of internationalization within NFSv4.
Despite the fact that NFSv4.0 and subsequent minor versions
have differed in many ways, the actual implementations of
internationalization have
remained the same and internationalized names have been handled
without regard to the minor version being used.  This is the reason the
document is able to treat internationalization for all NFSv4
minor versions
together.

During the period from the publication of RFC3010 {{RFC3010}} until now,
two different perspectives with regard to internationalization have
been held and represented, to varying degrees, in specifications for
NFSv4 minor versions.

* The perspective held by NFSv4 implementers treated most aspects of
  internationalization
  as basically outside the scope of what NFSv4 client and server
  implementers could deal with.  This was because the POSIX interface
  treated file names as uninterpreted strings of bytes, because the
  file systems used by NFSv4 servers treated file names similarly, and
  because those file systems contained files with internationalized
  names using a number of different encoding methods, chosen by
  the users of the POSIX interface. From this perspective, wider
  support for internationalized names and general use of universal
  encodings was a matter for users and applications and not for
  protocol implementers or designers.

* Within the IETF in general and in the IESG, there was a feeling
  that new protocols, such as NFSv4, could not avoid dealing with
  internationalization issues, making it difficult to treat these
  matters, as the implementers'
  perspective would have it, as essentially out of scope.

As specifications were developed, approved, and at times rewritten,
this fundamental difference of approach was never fully resolved,
although, with the publication of
RFC7530 {{RFC7530}}, a satisfactory
modus vivendi may have been arrived at.

Although many specifications were published dealing with NFSv4
internationalization, all minor versions used the same
implementation approach, even  when the current specification for
that minor version specified an entirely different approach.  As a
result, we need to treat the history of NFSv4 internationalization
below as an integrated whole, rather than treating individual minor
versions separately.


* The approach to internationalization specified in
  RFC3010 {{RFC3010}} sidestepped the conflict
  of approaches cited above by
  discussing the reasons that UTF-8 encoding was desirable
  while leaving file names as uninterpreted strings of bytes.
  The issue of string normalization was avoided by saying
  "The NFS version 4 protocol does not mandate the use of
  a particular normalization form at this time."

  Despite this approach's inconsistency with general IETF
  expectations regarding internationalization, RFC3010 was
  published as a Proposed Standard.   NFSv4.0 implementation related
  to internationalization of file names followed the same paradigm used
  by NFSv3, assuring interoperability with files created using
  that protocol, as well as with those created using local
  means of file creation.

* When it became necessary, because of issues with byte-range locking,
  to create an rfc3010bis, no change to the previously approved
  approach seemed indicated and the drafts submitted up until
  {{I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc3010bis}} closely followed RFC3010 as regards
  internationalization.
  The IESG then decided that a different approach to
  internationalization was required, to be based on stringprep
  {{RFC3454}} and rfc3010bis was accordingly revised, replacing all of
  the Internationalization section, before being published as RFC3530
  {{RFC3530}}.

  These changes required the rejection of file names that were
  not valid UTF-8, file names that included code points not, at the
  time of publication, assigned a Unicode character (e.g. capital eszett)
  or that were not allowed by stringprep (e.g. Zero-width joiner and
  non-joiner characters).
  Because these restrictions would have caused the set of valid file
  names to be different on NFS-mounted and local file systems
  there was no chance of them ever being implemented.

  Because these specification changes were made without working group
  involvement, most implementers were unaware of them while
  those who were aware of the changes ignored them and continued
  to develop implementations based on
  the internationalization approach specified in RFC3010.

* When NFsv4.1 was being developed, it seemed that no changes
  in internationalization would be needed.  Many working group
  participants were
  unaware of the stringprep-based requirements which made the NFSv4.0
  internationalization specified in RFC3530 unimplementable.
  As a result, the internationalization specified in
  RFC5661 {{RFC5661}} was based on that
  in RFC3530 {{RFC3530}}, although the addition of
  the attribute fs_charset_cap, discussed below, provided additional
  flexibility.

  The attribute fs_charset_cap, discussed below in {{CHARSET}} provides
  flags allowing the server to indicate that it accepts and processes
  non-UTF-8 file names.
  Rejecting them was a "MUST" in RFC3530 and became a "SHOULD" in
  RFC5661, although there is no evidence that any of these
  designations ever affected server behavior.

  Even though NFSv4.1 was a separate
  protocol and could
  have had a different approach to internationalization, for a
  considerable time, the internationalization specification
  for both protocols was based on stringprep (in RFC3530 and
  RFC5661)  while the actual implementations of the two minor
  versions both followed the approach specified in RFC3010, despite
  its obsoleted status.  This happened since most working group
  members were aware of the treatment internationalization by the
  various minor version RFCs.

* When work started on rfc3530bis it was clear that issues
  related to internationalization  had to be addressed.  When the
  implications of the stringprep references in RFC3530 were discussed with
  implementers it became clear that mandating that
  NFSv4.0 file names conform to stringprep was not appropriate.  While
  some working group members articulated the view that, because of the
  need to maintain compatibility with the POSIX interface and existing
  file systems, internationalization for NFSv4 could not be successfully
  addressed by the IETF, the rfc3530bis draft submitted to the IESG
  did not explicitly embrace the implementers' perspective as set forth
  above.

  The draft submitted to the IESG and
  RFC7530 {{RFC7530}} as published provided an
  explanation (see {{LIMITS}}) as to why restrictions on
  character encodings were not viable.  It allowed non-UTF-8 encodings to
  be used for internationalized file names while defining UTF-8 as the
  preferred encoding and allowing
  servers to reject non-UTF-8 string as invalid.   Other
  stringprep-based string restrictions were eliminated.
  With regard to
  normalization, it continued to defer the matter, leaving open the
  possibility that one might be chosen later.

  This approach is compatible, in implementation terms, with that
  specified in the obsolete document RFC3010 {{RFC3010}},
  allowing it to
  be used compatibly with existing implementations for all existing
  minor versions.   This is despite the fact that
  RFC8881 {{RFC8881}} specifies an entirely
  different approach.

  As a result of discussions leading up to the publishing of
  RFC7530, it was discovered that some local file systems used
  with NFSv4 were configured to be both normalization-aware and
  normalization-preserving, mapping all canonically equivalent
  file names to the same file while preserving the form actually
  used to create the file, of whatever form, normalized or not.
  This behavior, which is legal according to RFC3010, which says
  little about name mapping is probably illegal according to stringprep.
  Nevertheless, it was expressly pointed out in RFC7530 as a valid
  choice to deal with normalization issues, since it allows
  normalization-aware processing without the difficulties that arise
  in imposing a particular normalization form, as described in
  {{EQUIV-canon}}.

  In its discussion of internationalized domain names,
  RFC7530 {{RFC7530}} adopted an approach compatible
  with IDNA2003,
  rather than attempting to derive the specification from the behavior
  of existing implementations.

* When IDNA2003 was replaced by IDNA2008, the internationalization
  specified by {{RFC7530}} was not changed.  Also, it
  appears unlikely that implementations were changed to reflect that
  shift.

* NFSv4.2 made no changes to internationalization.  As a result,
  RFC7862 {{RFC7862}} which made no mention of
  internationalization, implicitly aligned internationalization
  in NFSv4.2 with that in NFSv4.1, as specified by
  RFC5661 {{RFC5661}}.

  As a result of this implicit alignment, there is no need for this
  document to specifically address NFSv4.2 or be marked as updating
  RFC7862.  It is sufficient that it updates RFC8881, which specifies
  the internationalization for NFSv4.1, inherited by NFSv4.2.

* Later, as work on the predecessors of this document was underway,
  further discussion of internationalization issues made
  it necessary that some gaps in the discussion of internationalization
  in {{RFC7530}} be filled in.  These gaps primarily
  concerned the need for NFSv4 clients to match the handling of the
  corresponding server when using cached file name data locally, or
  to avoid making invalid assumptions about that handling, when
  information on the details of such handling was not available.

The above history, can, for the purposes of the rest of this document
be summarized in the following statements:


* The actual treatment of internationalization within NFSv4 has not
  been affected by the particular minor version used, despite the fact
  that the specifications for the minor versions have often differed
  in their treatment of internationalization.

* With regard to file names, most implementations have followed the
  internationalization approach
  specified in RFC3010, which is compatible with the treatment in
  RFC7530.

* With regard to internationalized domain names, RFC7530 {{RFC7530}}
  specified an approach compatible with IDNA at the time of
  publication.
  However, no detailed analysis was done to determine whether NFSv4
  implementations actually followed that approach and it appears that
  many implementations used approaches that were much simpler.

* Because {{RFC7530}} did not specifically address the special issues
  that clients would face, relying on the assumption that each file is
  accessible only by its name.
  As this assumption is no longer true when internationalized name
  handling is in effect, the appropriate handling is discusssed
  below. {{EQUIV-clcache}} explains the options for handling in the case
  in which the client has very limited information about the details
  about the server's internationalization-related handling of file
  names while Appendices {{<INFO-casei}} {{<INFO-norm}} discuss how a
  client might use more complete information provided by new
  attributes.

In order to deal with all NFSv4 minor versions, this document
follows the internationalization approach defined in RFC7530, with
some changes discussed in {{CHG7530}} and applies that
approach to all NFSv4 minor versions.


# Future Minor Versions and Extensions {#FUTURE}

As presented in the document proper, all current NFSv4 minor
versions allow use of
arbitrary string encodings, allow servers a choice of whether to
be aware of normalization issues or not, and allow servers a number
of choices about how to address normalization issues.  This range of
choices reflects the need to accommodate existing file systems and user
expectations about character handling which in turn reflect the
assumptions of the POSIX model for the handling file names.

While it is theoretically
possible for a subsequent minor version to change these aspects of
the protocol (see {{RFC8178}}), this section will
explain why any such change is highly unlikely, making it expected
that these aspects of NFSv4 internationalization handling will be
retained indefinitely.  As a result, any new minor
version specification document that made such a change would
have to be marked as updating or obsoleting this document

No such change could be done as an extension to an existing minor
version or in a new minor version consisting only of OPTIONAL
features.   Such a change could only be done in a new minor version,
which, like minor version one, was prepared to be incompatible to some
degree with the previous minor versions.   While it appears unlikely
that such minor versions will be adopted, the possibility cannot be
excluded, so we need to explore the difficulties of changing the
aspects of internationalization handling mentioned above.


* Establishing UTF-8 as the sole means of encoding for internationalized
  characters, would make inaccessible existing files stored with other
  encodings.   Further, unless there were a corresponding change in
  the UNIX file interface model, it would cause the set of valid
  names for local and remote files to diverge.

* Imposing a particular normalization form, in the sense of refusing
  to create to allow access to files whose UTF-8-encoded names are
  not of the selected normalization form would give rise to similar
  difficulties.

* Defining a preferred normalization form to be returned as the names
  of all internationalized files, would result in applications having
  to deal with sudden unexplained changes of file names for existing
  files.

None of the above appears likely since there does not seem to be any
corresponding benefits to justify the difficulties that
adopting them would create.

There would also be difficulties in otherwise reducing the set of
three acceptable normalization handling options, without reducing it
to a single option by imposing a specific normalization form.


* Eliminating the possibility of a single possible normalization
  form, would pose similar difficulties to imposing the other one,
  even if representation-independent comparisons were also allowed.

  In either case, a specific normalization form would be disfavored,
  with no corresponding benefit.

* Allowing only representation-independent lookups would not impose
  difficulties for clients, but there are reasons to doubt it
  could be universally implemented, since such name comparisons
  would have to be done within the file system itself.

  Such a change could only be made once file system support
  for representation-independent file lookups would become commonly
  available.  As long as the POSIX file naming model continues
  its sway, that would be unlikely to happen.

One possible internationalization-related extension that the working
could adopt would be definition of OPTIONAL per-fs attributes defining
the internationalization-related handling for that file system.
That would allow clients to be aware of server choices in this area
and could be adopted without disrupting existing clients and servers.
Appendices {{<INFO-casei}} and {{<INFO-norm}} discuss the possible forms
of such attributes.
