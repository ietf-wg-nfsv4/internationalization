      </h2>
<p id="section-1-1">Internationalization is a complex topic with its own set of
terminology (see <span>[<a href="#RFC6365" class="cite xref">RFC6365</a>]</span>).  The topic is
made more difficult to understand for the NFSv4 protocols by
the complicated history
described in <a href="#HIST" class="auto internal xref">Appendix C</a>.   In large part, this document is based on the
actual behavior of NFSv4 client and server implementations
(for all existing minor versions).  It is intended to serve as a basis
for further implementations to be developed that can interact
with existing implementations.  It is expected to enable interoperation
with implementations to be developed
in the future.<a href="#section-1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-2">Note that the set of behaviors on which this document is based are
each effected
by a
combination of an NFSv4 server implementation proper and a
server-side underlying file system. It is common for servers
and underlying file systems to be configurable as to the behavior shown.
In the discussion below, each configuration that shows different
behavior is to be considered separately.<a href="#section-1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-3">As a consequence of this approach, normative terms defined
in <span>[<a href="#RFC2119" class="cite xref">RFC2119</a>]</span> are often derived from implementation
behavior, rather than the other way around, as is more commonly
the case.  The specifics
are discussed in <a href="#TERM" class="auto internal xref">Section 2</a>.<a href="#section-1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-4">With regard to the question of interoperability with existing
specifications for NFSv4 minor versions, different minor versions
pose different issues, even though the actual behavior is the same
for all minor versions.  This is because some of the specifications were
often adopted without the appropriate concern for usability,
implementability, or the expectations of existing NFS users.<a href="#section-1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-1-5.1">
          <p id="section-1-5.1.1">With regard to NFSv4.0 as defined in <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span>,
no significant interoperability
issues are expected to arise because the discussion of
internationalization in that
specification, which is the basis for this one, was also based
on the behavior of existing implementations.   Although, in a
formal sense, the treatment of internationalization here supersedes
that in <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span>, the treatments are intended to
be the same, in order to eliminate the possibility
of interoperability issues.<a href="#section-1-5.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-5.1.2">
Because of a change in the handling of Internationalized domain names,
there are some differences from the handling in <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span>, as
discussed in <a href="#HIST" class="auto internal xref">Appendix C</a>.
For a discussion of those differences and potential compatibility
issues, see Sections <a href="#OTHER-idna" class="auto internal xref">11.1</a> and <a href="#OTHER-compat" class="auto internal xref">11.2</a>.<a href="#section-1-5.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="section-1-5.2">
          <p id="section-1-5.2.1">With regard to NFSv4.1 as defined by <span>[<a href="#RFC8881" class="cite xref">RFC8881</a>]</span>,
the situation is
quite different.   The approach to internationalization specified
in that document, based in large part on that in RFC3530,
was never implemented, and implementers were either
unaware of the troublesome implications of that approach or
chose to ignore the existing specifications as essentially
unimplementable.  An
internationalization
approach compatible with that specified in <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span> tended to be followed,
despite the fact that, in other respects, NFSv4.1 was considered to be
a separate protocol from NFSv4.0.<a href="#section-1-5.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-5.2.2">
If there were NFSv4 servers who obeyed the internationalization
dictates
within <span>[<a href="#RFC5661" class="cite xref">RFC5661</a>]</span>, or clients that
expected servers to
do so, they would fail to interoperate with typical clients and servers
when dealing with non-UTF8 file names, which are quite common.  As
no such implementations have come to our attention, it has to be assumed
that they do not exist and interoperability with existing
implementations as described here is an appropriate basis for
this document.<a href="#section-1-5.2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-5.2.3">
The same applies to all existing minor versions beyond NFSv4.1
(i.e. to NFSv4.2), which made
no changes in the specification of internationalization-related
handling and for which existing implementation patterns were
maintained.<a href="#section-1-5.2.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
      </ul>
<p id="section-1-6">There is one area within the protocol for which existing implementations
are somewhat limited, so that it is not
always possible to derive the details of the specification from existing
implementations.  This area addresses situations in which,
in response to user needs, it is necessary to treat distinct strings
as equivalent based on an equivalence relation applying to UTF8-encoded
Unicode strings. In order to provide this internationalization-related
functionality, it is necessary, as described in <a href="#SERVTYPES" class="auto internal xref">Section 6</a>, for the
server to be aware of the encoding
of strings used for file names, as UTF8-encoded Unicode.<a href="#section-1-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-7">There are several classes of equivalence relations, for which we
have limited implementation experience:<a href="#section-1-7" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-1-8.1">
          <p id="section-1-8.1.1">NFSv4 implementations <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> treat two canonically
equivalent
strings as denoting the same object.<a href="#section-1-8.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-8.1.2">
While the ability for servers to do that is an NFSv4 design
requirement necessary to provide support for Unicode normalization,
and some implementations do exist,
there has, so far, been little demand for this feature and
current implementations are not heavily used.<a href="#section-1-8.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-8.1.3">
As a result, the support for such features described here, while
derived from implementation experience, has only been used
in a small set of situations and might have difficulties with
some existing clients that do various forms of name caching.
See <a href="#EQUIV-canon" class="auto internal xref">Section 7.1</a> for further
discussion.<a href="#section-1-8.1.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="section-1-8.2">
          <p id="section-1-8.2.1">NFSv4 implementations <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> treat two
strings that differ only as to case as denoting the same object.
While server implementations exist, the details are unclear because
of the complexity of case-mapping and case-based string equivalence
in an internationalized environment.<a href="#section-1-8.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-8.2.2">
Because the details of case mapping and case-insensitive string
comparison can be complex in an internationalized environment,
with desirable mappings depending on user preference and the use
of different languages, the definition of appropriate mappings
cannot be done within this specification, although the issues that
need to be dealt with are discussed in <a href="#EQUIV-case" class="auto internal xref">Section 7.2</a><a href="#section-1-8.2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

file system objects.  The details of how these types affect
the handling of potential string equivalence relationships are
discussed in <a href="#EQUIV" class="auto internal xref">Section 7</a>.<a href="#section-6-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          <p id="section-6-3.1.1">Servers which do not rely on knowledge of the encoding used
for name strings are termed "UTF8-unaware".  Because such
servers, when handling file names, do not rely on any
particular encoding
being used, they can be used with a range of character
encodings, in the same way that was done when using NFSv3.<a href="#section-6-3.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-3.1.2">
This flexibility is necessary to enable access to existing
files stored with names using existing encodings.
However, the lack of
server knowledge of the encoding used results in such
servers' inability to provide the kind of services described
in <a href="#EQUIV" class="auto internal xref">Section 7</a> that rely on the ability to treat
sets of distinct strings as equivalent, for the purpose of
handling normalization issues and providing case-insensitivity.<a href="#section-6-3.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-3.1.3">
Because the server has no ability to define name string
equivalence relations, clients can cache names without

equivalence relations that treat defined sets of strings as
equivalent for naming purposes.<a href="#section-6-3.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6-3.2.2">
Because of the ability of such servers to define name
equivalence relations, certain forms of name caching can be
interfered with because the client is not aware of the
equivalence relation used. Because of this lack of knowledge,
forms of name caching where the name used to refer to a file

See <a href="#IMPL-formi" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.2</a> for a discussion of implementing

<p id="section-7-1">Although many NFSv4 implementations continue the approach to
string names used in NFSv3 in which the only equivalent strings

sort of string equivalence relations as described in Sections

<p id="section-7-2">The earlier approach dealt with internationalization outside the scope
of the protocol, by making internationalization the job of the
user, requiring the client user and server to agree on the
character encoding being used while the implementations themselves
strived for
character-encoding neutrality with knowledge of the encoding by the
implementations limited to the encoding of strings such as
"/", ".", and "..".<a href="#section-7-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-7-3">As discussed later in <a href="#SERVTYPES" class="auto internal xref">Section 6</a>, NFSv4 supports
multiple modes of operation in dealing with these matters.
While NFSv4 supports the older mode of operation by allowing
UTF8-unaware file systems, the  protocol also supports the
use of UTF8-aware file systems in which both sides of the
implementation deal with filenames as UTF8-encoded Unicode strings,
enabling
equivalence classes of those strings to be used within the protocol.<a href="#section-7-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-7-4">When equivalence classes of string are implemented, this can be done

<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="section-7-5.1">
          <p id="section-7-5.1.1">Equivalent strings are treated as identical in matching names

</li>
      </ul>
<p id="section-7-6">The existence of distinct equivalent strings does not, by and large,
cause troublesome issues for clients, who can function without
detailed knowledge of the equivalence relation(s) implemented.
However, as noted in <a href="#EQUIV-clcache" class="auto internal xref">Section 7.3</a>, certain
forms of client caching are not workable or need to be

<li class="normal" id="section-7.1-2.1">
            <p id="section-7.1-2.1.1">In some cases, two Unicode values are assigned to a single

considered canonically equivalent.<a href="#section-7.1-2.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

          <li class="normal" id="section-7.1-2.2">
            <p id="section-7.1-2.2.1">There are a large number of situations in which a particular
symbol can be represented as a single character or as a combination
of a base character and a combining character adding a
diacritic.  For example,
LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E ACUTE (U+00C9) can also represented by
LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E (U+0045) followed by
COMBINING ACTUE ACCENT (U+0301).  These two strings are
canonically equivalent.<a href="#section-7.1-2.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

Specification of users and groups in the "id@domain" format within

NFsv2 <span>[<a href="#RFC1094" class="cite xref">RFC1094</a>]</span>.
While one obstacle to expansion
was eliminated, most implementations were unable to actually effect
that expansion, principally because the underlying file systems used
assume that user and group identifiers fit in 32 bits each and the
vnode interfaces used by server implementations make similar
assumptions.<a href="#section-11.2-2.3.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-14-1">Unicode in the form of UTF-8 is generally used for file component
names (i.e., both directory and file components).  However,
other character sets may also be allowed for these names.
For the owner and owner_group attributes and other sorts strings
whose form is affected by standards outside NFSv4 (see <a href="#OTHER" class="auto internal xref">Section 11</a>.) are
always encoded as UTF-8.
String processing (e.g., Unicode normalization) raises
security concerns for string comparison.  See
Sections <a href="#OTHER" class="auto internal xref">11</a> and <a href="#EQUIV" class="auto internal xref">7</a> as well as the respective
Sections 5.9 of RFC7530 <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span> and
RFC8881 <span>[<a href="#RFC8881" class="cite xref">RFC8881</a>]</span> for further discussion. See <span>[<a href="#RFC6943" class="cite xref">RFC6943</a>]</span> for related
identifier comparison security considerations.  File
component names are identifiers with respect to the identifier
comparison discussion in <span>[<a href="#RFC6943" class="cite xref">RFC6943</a>]</span> because they are
used to identify the objects to which ACLs are applied (See the
respective Sections 6 of RFC7530 <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span> and

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.1-1">In this section, we discuss many of the interesting and/or troublesome
issues that the need for case-insensitive handling gives rise to in
fully internationalized environments.
Many of these are also discussed in <span>[<a href="#UNICODE-CASEM" class="cite xref">UNICODE-CASEM</a>]</span>.
However, our treatment of these issues, while not inconsistent with
that in <span>[<a href="#UNICODE-CASEM" class="cite xref">UNICODE-CASEM</a>]</span>, differs significantly for a number of
reasons:<a href="#appendix-A.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-A.1-2.1">
            <p id="appendix-A.1-2.1.1">Our primary focus is on case-insensitive string comparison rather
than with case mapping per se.
While such comparison is natural for the client and allowed for
servers, its greater flexibility makes it important to understand
its capabilities in dealing with potentially troublesome issues in
providing case-insensitive file name handling.<a href="#appendix-A.1-2.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="appendix-A.1-2.2">
            <p id="appendix-A.1-2.2.1">Because a case mapping model forces the specification of a single
case mapping result when there are multiple potentially valid results,
there are inevitably cases in which the result chosen is
inappropriate for some users.  These are cases in which F-type
and S-type mappings are present and in which C-type and T-type
mappings conflict.  Normally, an appropriate choice is selected by
use of the locale, but in a file system environment, valid locale
information might not be present.   As a result,
case-insensitive string
comparison, which does not force such case mapping choices,
will be more
desirable since it allows construction of sets of equivalent
strings
based on multiple mappings which is not possible when case
mapping is the goal.<a href="#appendix-A.1-2.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        </ul>
<p id="appendix-A.1-3">The examples below present common situations that go beyond the
simple invertible case mappings of Latin characters and the
straightforward
adaptation of that model to Greek and Cyrillic.  In EX4 and EX5
we have case-based sets of equivalent strings including multi-character
strings not derived from canonical equivalences while for EX7 and EX8
all multi-character strings are derived from canonical
equivalences.  In addition, EX1, EX2, EX3 and EX6 discuss other
situations
in which a set of equivalent strings has more than two elements.<a href="#appendix-A.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="appendix-A.2-1">When a server implements case-insensitive file name handling, it
is desirable that clients do so as well.  For example, if a client
possessing the cached contents of a directory, notes that the file
"a" does not exist, it cannot immediately act on that presumed
non-existence, without checking for the potential existence of "A"
as well.  As a result, clients, in order to do certain form of
name caching, might need to be able to provide
case-insensitive name comparisons, irrespective of whether the
server handling is case-preserving or not.<a href="#appendix-A.2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.2-2">Because case-insensitive name comparisons are not always as
straightforward
as the above example suggests, the client, if it is to emulate
the server's name handling, would need information about how certain
cases are to be dealt with.  In cases in which that information is
unavailable, the client needs to avoid making assumptions about the
server's handling, since it will be unaware of the Unicode version
implemented by the server, or many of the details of specific issues
that might need to be addressed differently by different server
file systems in implementing
case-insensitive name handling.<a href="#appendix-A.2-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

            <p id="appendix-B.2-6.1.1">Two strings may differ only because each has a different one of two
code points that are essentially the same. Three code points
assigned to represent units, are essentially equivalent to the
character denoting those units.  For example, the OHM SIGN (U+2126)
is essentially identical to the GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA (U+03A9)
as MICRO SIGN (U+00B5) is to GREEK SMALL LETTER MU (U+03BC) and
ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B) is to
LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5).<a href="#appendix-B.2-6.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.2-6.1.2">
As discussed in items EX2 and EX3 in <a href="#INFO-casei-ex" class="auto internal xref">Appendix A.1</a>, it
is possible to adjust for this situation using tables designed to
resolve case-insensitive equivalence, essentially treating the
unit symbols as an additional case variant, essentially
ignoring the fact that the
graphic representation is the same.  As a result, those doing string
comparisons that are both form-insensitive and case-insensitive do
not need to address this issue as part of form-insensitivity, since
it would be dealt with by existing case-insensitive comparison logic.<a href="#appendix-B.2-6.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.2-6.1.3">
Where there is no case-insensitive comparison logic, this function

<p id="appendix-B.2-6.2.2">
Although, as discussed in items EX3 in <a href="#INFO-casei-ex" class="auto internal xref">Appendix A.1</a>,
it is possible to use tables designed to resolve case-insensitive
equivalence by providing as possible case-insensitively equivalent
string, multi-character string providing the decomposition of
precomposed characters, special logic to do so is only necessary
when the decomposition is not a canonical one, i.e. it is a
compatibility equivalence.<a href="#appendix-B.2-6.2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.2-6.2.3">
In general, the table used to do comparisons, whether case-sensitive
or not, needs to provide information about the canonical
decomposition of precomposed characters.  See <a href="#FORMI-table" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.2.2</a> for details.<a href="#appendix-B.2-6.2.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

There is no way this function could be performed within code

equivalence once it is determined that the base characters are
case-equivalent while there is a difference of combining characters
in to be resolved.

<p id="appendix-B.2.1-1">We discussed in <a href="#IMPL-casei" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.1</a> the construction of a
case-insensitive file name hash.   While such a hash could also
be form-insensitive if the hash contribution of every
pre-composed character matched the combined contribution of the
characters that it decomposes into.<a href="#appendix-B.2.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.2.1-2">However, there is no obvious way that sort of hash could respect
the canonical equivalence of multiple combining characters
modifying the same base character, when those combining
characters appear in different orders.  Addressing that issue
would require a significantly different sort of hash, in which
combining characters are treated differently from others, so that
the re-ordering of a string of combining characters applying to the
same base character will not affect the hash.<a href="#appendix-B.2.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.2.1-3">In the hash discussed in <a href="#IMPL-casei" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.1</a>, there is no
guarantee that the hash for multiple combining characters
presented in different orders will be the same.   This is because
typically such hashes implement some transformation on the
existing hash, together with adding the new character to the hash
being accumulated.  Such methods of hash construction will
arrive at different values if
the ordering of combining characters changes.<a href="#appendix-B.2.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.2.1-4">In order to create a hash with the necessary characteristics, one can
construct a separate sub-hash for composite character, consisting
of one non-combining character (may be pre-composed) together with the
set (possibly null) of combining characters immediately following it.
Each such composed character, whether precomposed or not, will have
its own sub-hash, which will be the same regardless of the order of
the combining characters.<a href="#appendix-B.2.1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.2.1-5">If the hash is to include case-insensitivity, special handling is
needed to deal with issues arising from the handling of
COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI (U+0345).   That combining character, as
discussed in item EX6 of <a href="#INFO-casei-ex" class="auto internal xref">Appendix A.1</a> is uppercased to
the non-combining character GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA (U+0399) which is
in turn lowercased to the non-combining character GREEK SMALL
LETTER IOTA (U+03B9).  As a result,  when computing a case-insensitive
hash, when a base character is IOTA (of either case) and the previous
base character is ALPHA, ETA, or OMEGA (of the same case as the IOTA),
that IOTA is treated, for the purpose of defining the composite
characters for which to generate sub-hashes as if it were a combining
character.  As a result, in this case a string of containing two
composite characters will be treated as were a single
composite character since the iota will be treated as if it were a
combining character.   This string will have its own sub-hash, which
will be the same regardless of the order of combining characters.<a href="#appendix-B.2.1-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.2.1-6">The same outline will be followed for generating hashes which are
to be form-insensitive (only) and for those which are to be both
form-insensitive and case-insensitive. The initial value, representing
the base character, will differ based on the type of hash, as
discussed below.<a href="#appendix-B.2.1-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

OHM SIGN (U+2126), ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B), and MICRO SIGN (U+00B5)
as characters distinct from the letters that represent these code
points.

characters appearing in a wide range of bit positions in the rest
of the word to limit the degree that multiple distinct sets of
combining characters have value that are the same.  Although the details
will be affected by processor cache structure and the distribution
of names processed, a

that a common point in both comparands be found to resume

when there is a multi-character string that as the case- insensitive
equivalent of a single base character, as discussed in items EX4 and

These are best dealt with using the approach outlined in <a href="#IMPL-casei" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.1</a>.
When it is noted that the current base character (for either
comparand) is a character whose associated equivalence class contains
one or more multi-character strings, then these comparisons, normally
requiring that each base character be mapped to the same case-based
equivalence class be modified to allow equivalences allowed by these
multi-character sequences.<a href="#appendix-B.2.4-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

more efficient manner than described in <a href="#IMPL-formi" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.2</a>.<a href="#appendix-B.3-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-2">One important group of strings is those in which all of the
characters consist of a single byte. We call these strings
the UTF8-onebyte subset. A string's membership in this subset can
be easily determined as part of UTF8-compliance checking,
hash generation, or a preliminary byte-by-byte comparison to a
string whose membership status in this subset is already known.<a href="#appendix-B.3-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-3">As a result, there are many situations in which a form-independent
string comparison can be done without reference to detailed character
tables or any UTF8-to-UCS conversions. Examples follow:<a href="#appendix-B.3-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-B.3-4.1">
            <p id="appendix-B.3-4.1.1">If the current file system is case-sensitive and either of two
strings being compared are a member of the UTF8-onebyte subset
the result of a byte-by-byte comparison of the two strings can
be accepted as definitive without any reference to the details
of the particular canonical equivalence relation used.<a href="#appendix-B.3-4.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-4.1.2">
When neither of the strings being compared are a member of the
UTF8-onebyte subset, there are further opportunities for optimized
comparisons, discussed below.<a href="#appendix-B.3-4.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-4.1.3">
This applies regardless of the particular Unicode version used.<a href="#appendix-B.3-4.1.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="appendix-B.3-4.2">
            <p id="appendix-B.3-4.2.1">If the current file system is case-insensitive and the handling of
case equivalence is such that LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069),
and LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) are considered equivalent,
then, when both of the strings being compared are members of
UTF8-onebyte subset, a positive result for the comparison can be
immediately accepted but a negative result,
need to be supplemented by simple version of case-insensitive
comparison
using a 127-byte table mapping each letter to other-case
equivalent.  If this succeeds the strings are equivalent, while,
if it does not, all the complexities of form-insensitive string
comparisons need to be taken account of.<a href="#appendix-B.3-4.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-4.2.2">
This applies regardless of the particular Unicode version used.<a href="#appendix-B.3-4.2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="appendix-B.3-4.3">
            <p id="appendix-B.3-4.3.1">If the current file system is case-insensitive and the handling of
case equivalence is such that either LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069),
and LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) are not considered equivalent,
or the handling of these characters is unknown (client only) than a
variant of the above can be used.<a href="#appendix-B.3-4.3.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-4.3.2">
In this variant, when a byte-by-byte comparison results in a
negative result, a byte-by-byte comparison still needs to be
done but the mapping table used is different in that it does not
map LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) and
LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) to each other but maps each
character to itself as it does for characters that have no case.<a href="#appendix-B.3-4.3.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        </ul>
<p id="appendix-B.3-5">When the procedures above are not usable, further opportunities
for optimized handling depend on case-sensitivity. For case-sensitive
file systems, there are optimized approaches to name comparisons
that can be used when either or both of the names being compared
is not a member of the UTF8-onebyte subset.<a href="#appendix-B.3-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-6">The alternative allows a byte-by-byte comparison to be used for
name comparison if at least one of the names belong to the
canonical-singleton subset of strings, defined as those strings
that are known to have no canonically equivalent strings.
Two important facts, which implementations can take advantage of,
are the following:<a href="#appendix-B.3-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-B.3-7.1">
            <p id="appendix-B.3-7.1.1">The UTF8-onebyte subset is contained within the canonical-singleton
subset.<a href="#appendix-B.3-7.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-7.1.2">
This fact can be taken advantage of when one of the two string to
be compared is a member of the UTF8-onebyte subset, so no further
checking is necessary in this case.  As a result additional testing
for membership in the canonical-singleton subset only needs to be
done when neither of the two strings is a member of the
UTF8-onebyte subset.<a href="#appendix-B.3-7.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="appendix-B.3-7.2">
            <p id="appendix-B.3-7.2.1">This set can be usefully defined without reference to the particular
version of Unicode to be used.  This allows this set to be used
by clients in testing names for suitability for negative name
caching, as described in <a href="#IMPL-cache" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.4</a>.<a href="#appendix-B.3-7.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-7.2.2">
The set of characters can be defined as all the characters defined
in a relatively early version of Unicode with certain exclusions,
excluding characters which are the NFC form of some string, combining
characters, defined as those ever present within some NFD form of
a one-character string, together with OHM SIGN (U+2126).<a href="#appendix-B.3-7.2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.3-7.2.3">
This set does not have to be changed with new Unicode versions,
since, while it possible for them to add new characters to this set
it is impossible to remove them since that would require converting
a previously-existing character to be a combining character or
given it a new decomposition which is impossible.<a href="#appendix-B.3-7.2.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        </ul>
<p id="appendix-B.3-8">Implementations are likely to implement a test for strings in the
canonical-singleton subset, limited to strings which are limited
to strings whose UTF-8 encoding includes no character requiring
more than two bytes to encode.   In testing for membership in this
subset one-but character can be ignored and two-byte character
need to checked against a 240-byte read-only bitmap whose bytes are
likely to be available quite quickly in processor caches.<a href="#appendix-B.3-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-B.4-1">Given the name caching difficulties mentioned in <a href="#EQUIV-clcache" class="auto internal xref">Section 7.3</a> and
the typical lack of information regarding the details many clients
will want to limit name caching as described in that section.
However, there might be situations in which other approaches are
desirable and we discuss the issues below:<a href="#appendix-B.4-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-B.4-2.1">
            <p id="appendix-B.4-2.1.1">For case-sensitive file systems, name which are in the
canonical-singleton subset can effectively cached, so
clients could use the full-range of name-caching techniques
for such names, even the absence of detailed information
about the canonical equivalence relation being used.<a href="#appendix-B.4-2.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.4-2.1.2">
There is overhead added by this check on the client,
since, unlike the server case, there is no opportunity to
combine this check with validation of UTF-8 encoding.
Nevertheless, that overhead is quite small so it is likely
that clients will implement it for UTF8-aware file system that
are case-sensitive, rather than living with restricted name
caching, as described in <a href="#EQUIV-clcache" class="auto internal xref">Section 7.3</a>.<a href="#appendix-B.4-2.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
          <li class="normal" id="appendix-B.4-2.2">
            <p id="appendix-B.4-2.2.1">For case-insensitive file systems, the situation is different.
Even for the UTF8-onebyte subset, the possibilities of unexpected
equivalence due to issues with dotted and dotless i, sharp s,
and various ligatures means that simple case-based equivalences
cannot be assumed.<a href="#appendix-B.4-2.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-B.4-2.2.2">
As a result, clients handling case-insensitive file systems
are most likely to simply avoid potentially troublesome
forms of name caching, unless full information on the equivalence
relation is available.  In the case that it is available, all
forms of name caching would be possible, but that requires the
implementation on the client of the comparison methods described
in <a href="#IMPL-formi" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.2</a> together with the potential
optimizations discussed in <a href="#IMPL-opt" class="auto internal xref">Appendix B.3</a>.<a href="#appendix-B.4-2.2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="appendix-C-1">This section describes the history of internationalization within NFSv4.
Despite the fact that NFSv4.0 and subsequent minor versions
have differed in many ways, the actual implementations of
internationalization have
remained the same and internationalized names have been handled
without regard to the minor version being used.  This is the reason the
document is able to treat internationalization for all NFSv4
minor versions
together.<a href="#appendix-C-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-2">During the period from the publication of RFC3010 <span>[<a href="#RFC3010" class="cite xref">RFC3010</a>]</span> until now,
two different perspectives with regard to internationalization have
been held and represented, to varying degrees, in specifications for
NFSv4 minor versions.<a href="#appendix-C-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-C-3.1">
          <p id="appendix-C-3.1.1">The perspective held by NFSv4 implementers treated most aspects of
internationalization
as basically outside the scope of what NFSv4 client and server
implementers could deal with.  This was because the POSIX interface
treated file names as uninterpreted strings of bytes, because the
file systems used by NFSv4 servers treated file names similarly, and
because those file systems contained files with internationalized
names using a number of different encoding methods, chosen by
the users of the POSIX interface. From this perspective, wider
support for internationalized names and general use of universal
encodings was a matter for users and applications and not for
protocol implementers or designers.<a href="#appendix-C-3.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="appendix-C-3.2">
          <p id="appendix-C-3.2.1">Within the IETF in general and in the IESG, there was a feeling
that new protocols, such as NFSv4, could not avoid dealing with
internationalization issues, making it difficult to treat these
matters, as the implementers'
perspective would have it, as essentially out of scope.<a href="#appendix-C-3.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
      </ul>
<p id="appendix-C-4">As specifications were developed, approved, and at times rewritten,
this fundamental difference of approach was never fully resolved,
although, with the publication of
RFC7530 <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span>, a satisfactory
modus vivendi may have been arrived at.<a href="#appendix-C-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-5">Although many specifications were published dealing with NFSv4
internationalization, all minor versions used the same
implementation approach, even  when the current specification for
that minor version specified an entirely different approach.  As a
result, we need to treat the history of NFSv4 internationalization
below as an integrated whole, rather than treating individual minor
versions separately.<a href="#appendix-C-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-C-6.1">
          <p id="appendix-C-6.1.1">The approach to internationalization specified in
RFC3010 <span>[<a href="#RFC3010" class="cite xref">RFC3010</a>]</span> sidestepped the conflict
of approaches cited above by
discussing the reasons that UTF-8 encoding was desirable
while leaving file names as uninterpreted strings of bytes.
The issue of string normalization was avoided by saying
"The NFS version 4 protocol does not mandate the use of
a particular normalization form at this time."<a href="#appendix-C-6.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.1.2">
Despite this approach's inconsistency with general IETF
expectations regarding internationalization, RFC3010 was
published as a Proposed Standard.   NFSv4.0 implementation related
to internationalization of file names followed the same paradigm used
by NFSv3, assuring interoperability with files created using
that protocol, as well as with those created using local
means of file creation.<a href="#appendix-C-6.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="appendix-C-6.2">
          <p id="appendix-C-6.2.1">When it became necessary, because of issues with byte-range locking,
to create an rfc3010bis, no change to the previously approved
approach seemed indicated and the drafts submitted up until
<span>[<a href="#I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc3010bis" class="cite xref">I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc3010bis</a>]</span> closely followed RFC3010 as regards
internationalization.
The IESG then decided that a different approach to
internationalization was required, to be based on stringprep
<span>[<a href="#RFC3454" class="cite xref">RFC3454</a>]</span> and rfc3010bis was accordingly revised, replacing all of
the Internationalization section, before being published as RFC3530
<span>[<a href="#RFC3530" class="cite xref">RFC3530</a>]</span>.<a href="#appendix-C-6.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.2.2">
These changes required the rejection of file names that were
not valid UTF-8, file names that included code points not, at the
time of publication, assigned a Unicode character (e.g. capital eszett)
or that were not allowed by stringprep (e.g. Zero-width joiner and
non-joiner characters).
Because these restrictions would have caused the set of valid file
names to be different on NFS-mounted and local file systems
there was no chance of them ever being implemented.<a href="#appendix-C-6.2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.2.3">
Because these specification changes were made without working group
involvement, most implementers were unaware of them while
those who were aware of the changes ignored them and continued
to develop implementations based on
the internationalization approach specified in RFC3010.<a href="#appendix-C-6.2.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="appendix-C-6.3">
          <p id="appendix-C-6.3.1">When NFsv4.1 was being developed, it seemed that no changes
in internationalization would be needed.  Many working group
participants were
unaware of the stringprep-based requirements which made the NFSv4.0
internationalization specified in RFC3530 unimplementable.
As a result, the internationalization specified in
RFC5661 <span>[<a href="#RFC5661" class="cite xref">RFC5661</a>]</span> was based on that
in RFC3530 <span>[<a href="#RFC3530" class="cite xref">RFC3530</a>]</span>, although the addition of
the attribute fs_charset_cap, discussed below, provided additional
flexibility.<a href="#appendix-C-6.3.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.3.2">
The attribute fs_charset_cap, discussed below in <a href="#CHARSET" class="auto internal xref">Section 9</a> provides
flags allowing the server to indicate that it accepts and processes
non-UTF-8 file names.
Rejecting them was a "<span class="bcp14">MUST</span>" in RFC3530 and became a "<span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span>" in
RFC5661, although there is no evidence that any of these
designations ever affected server behavior.<a href="#appendix-C-6.3.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.3.3">
Even though NFSv4.1 was a separate
protocol and could
have had a different approach to internationalization, for a
considerable time, the internationalization specification
for both protocols was based on stringprep (in RFC3530 and
RFC5661)  while the actual implementations of the two minor
versions both followed the approach specified in RFC3010, despite
its obsoleted status.  This happened since most working group
members were aware of the treatment internationalization by the
various minor version RFCs.<a href="#appendix-C-6.3.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="appendix-C-6.4">
          <p id="appendix-C-6.4.1">When work started on rfc3530bis it was clear that issues
related to internationalization  had to be addressed.  When the
implications of the stringprep references in RFC3530 were discussed with
implementers it became clear that mandating that
NFSv4.0 file names conform to stringprep was not appropriate.  While
some working group members articulated the view that, because of the
need to maintain compatibility with the POSIX interface and existing
file systems, internationalization for NFSv4 could not be successfully
addressed by the IETF, the rfc3530bis draft submitted to the IESG
did not explicitly embrace the implementers' perspective as set forth
above.<a href="#appendix-C-6.4.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.4.2">
The draft submitted to the IESG and
RFC7530 <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span> as published provided an
explanation (see <a href="#LIMITS" class="auto internal xref">Section 5</a>) as to why restrictions on
character encodings were not viable.  It allowed non-UTF-8 encodings to
be used for internationalized file names while defining UTF-8 as the
preferred encoding and allowing
servers to reject non-UTF-8 string as invalid.   Other
stringprep-based string restrictions were eliminated.
With regard to
normalization, it continued to defer the matter, leaving open the
possibility that one might be chosen later.<a href="#appendix-C-6.4.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.4.3">
This approach is compatible, in implementation terms, with that
specified in the obsolete document RFC3010 <span>[<a href="#RFC3010" class="cite xref">RFC3010</a>]</span>,
allowing it to
be used compatibly with existing implementations for all existing
minor versions.   This is despite the fact that
RFC8881 <span>[<a href="#RFC8881" class="cite xref">RFC8881</a>]</span> specifies an entirely
different approach.<a href="#appendix-C-6.4.3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.4.4">
As a result of discussions leading up to the publishing of
RFC7530, it was discovered that some local file systems used
with NFSv4 were configured to be both normalization-aware and
normalization-preserving, mapping all canonically equivalent
file names to the same file while preserving the form actually
used to create the file, of whatever form, normalized or not.
This behavior, which is legal according to RFC3010, which says
little about name mapping is probably illegal according to stringprep.
Nevertheless, it was expressly pointed out in RFC7530 as a valid
choice to deal with normalization issues, since it allows
normalization-aware processing without the difficulties that arise
in imposing a particular normalization form, as described in
<a href="#EQUIV-canon" class="auto internal xref">Section 7.1</a>.<a href="#appendix-C-6.4.4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-C-6.4.5">
In its discussion of internationalized domain names,
RFC7530 <span>[<a href="#RFC7530" class="cite xref">RFC7530</a>]</span> adopted an approach compatible
with IDNA2003,

      </h2>
<p id="appendix-D-1">As presented in the document proper, all current NFSv4 minor
versions allow use of
arbitrary string encodings, allow servers a choice of whether to
be aware of normalization issues or not, and allow servers a number
of choices about how to address normalization issues.  This range of
choices reflects the need to accommodate existing file systems and user
expectations about character handling which in turn reflect the
assumptions of the POSIX model for the handling file names.<a href="#appendix-D-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-D-2">While it is theoretically
possible for a subsequent minor version to change these aspects of
the protocol (see <span>[<a href="#RFC8178" class="cite xref">RFC8178</a>]</span>), this section will
explain why any such change is highly unlikely, making it expected
that these aspects of NFSv4 internationalization handling will be
retained indefinitely.  As a result, any new minor
version specification document that made such a change would
have to be marked as updating or obsoleting this document<a href="#appendix-D-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-D-3">No such change could be done as an extension to an existing minor
version or in a new minor version consisting only of <span class="bcp14">OPTIONAL</span>
features.   Such a change could only be done in a new minor version,
which, like minor version one, was prepared to be incompatible to some
degree with the previous minor versions.   While it appears unlikely
that such minor versions will be adopted, the possibility cannot be
excluded, so we need to explore the difficulties of changing the
aspects of internationalization handling mentioned above.<a href="#appendix-D-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-D-4.1">
          <p id="appendix-D-4.1.1">Establishing UTF-8 as the sole means of encoding for internationalized
characters, would make inaccessible existing files stored with other
encodings.   Further, unless there were a corresponding change in
the UNIX file interface model, it would cause the set of valid
names for local and remote files to diverge.<a href="#appendix-D-4.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="appendix-D-4.2">
          <p id="appendix-D-4.2.1">Imposing a particular normalization form, in the sense of refusing
to create to allow access to files whose UTF-8-encoded names are
not of the selected normalization form would give rise to similar
difficulties.<a href="#appendix-D-4.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="appendix-D-4.3">
          <p id="appendix-D-4.3.1">Defining a preferred normalization form to be returned as the names
of all internationalized files, would result in applications having
to deal with sudden unexplained changes of file names for existing
files.<a href="#appendix-D-4.3.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
      </ul>
<p id="appendix-D-5">None of the above appears likely since there does not seem to be any
corresponding benefits to justify the difficulties that
adopting them would create.<a href="#appendix-D-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-D-6">There would also be difficulties in otherwise reducing the set of
three acceptable normalization handling options, without reducing it
to a single option by imposing a specific normalization form.<a href="#appendix-D-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<ul class="normal">
<li class="normal" id="appendix-D-7.1">
          <p id="appendix-D-7.1.1">Eliminating the possibility of a single possible normalization
form, would pose similar difficulties to imposing the other one,
even if representation-independent comparisons were also allowed.<a href="#appendix-D-7.1.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-D-7.1.2">
In either case, a specific normalization form would be disfavored,
with no corresponding benefit.<a href="#appendix-D-7.1.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
        <li class="normal" id="appendix-D-7.2">
          <p id="appendix-D-7.2.1">Allowing only representation-independent lookups would not impose
difficulties for clients, but there are reasons to doubt it
could be universally implemented, since such name comparisons
would have to be done within the file system itself.<a href="#appendix-D-7.2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-D-7.2.2">
Such a change could only be made once file system support
for representation-independent file lookups would become commonly
available.  As long as the POSIX file naming model continues
its sway, that would be unlikely to happen.<a href="#appendix-D-7.2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
</li>
      </ul>
<p id="appendix-D-8">One possible internationalization-related extension that the working
could adopt would be definition of <span class="bcp14">OPTIONAL</span> per-fs attributes defining
the internationalization-related handling for that file system.
That would allow clients to be aware of server choices in this area
and could be adopted without disrupting existing clients and servers.
Appendices <a href="#INFO-casei" class="auto internal xref">A.3</a> and <a href="#INFO-norm" class="auto internal xref">A.4</a> discuss the possible forms
of such attributes.<a href="#appendix-D-8" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
